      bio: "Binglu Wang is a Ph.D. candidate in Management & Organizations (MORS) at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, with affiliations at the Center for Science of Science and Innovation (CSSI) and the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO). Her scholarly inquiry centers on Innovation & Science, Cross-Cultural Evaluation, and Social Networks. Employing computational methodologies alongside field experiments, her current research endeavors aim to understand how social learning mechanisms—such as observation, feedback, cooperation, and cultural transmission—facilitate or obstruct the processes of innovation incubation and evaluation within the realms of Science, Culture, and Entrepreneurship, drawing on large-scale archival and experimental data. She received her bachelor's degree in Information Management and Information Systems from Peking University in 2019. Binglu is also a 2021 SICSS alum."
