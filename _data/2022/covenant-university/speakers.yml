  bio: "<p align='justify'>Yudhvir Seetharam is currently an Associate Professor in the School of Economics and Finance; and the Head of Analytics, Insights and Research for FNB Business. He holds a Ph.D from the University of the Witwatersrand in the field of behavioural finance and is extensively involved in both academia and practice, as evidenced by regular media engagements, memberships in societies and awards. <br/><br/> Yudhvir's area of focus is on the application of empirical (analytical) techniques to finance (broadly defined as both investments and corporate finance), with an emphasis on incorporating investor psychology/biases into these techniques. Interest in this field is relatively scarce in South Africa, but there has been growth over the past decade. While this area may seem broad, the underlying theme is on applying inter-disciplinary approaches in solving traditional problems in the financial field. As such, there are neighbouring applications in the field of Financial Technology (such as “big data” and “data science”) and in risk management. <br/><br/> He has published extensively in local and international journals, such as the Investment Analysts Journal, International Journal of Emerging Markets, Eurasian Business Review, inter alia. Yudhvir is an Editorial Board member of the Journal of Business Analytics; an Editor for Cogent Economics and Finance and Springer Nature: Business and Economics. He is also the Managing Editor for the South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences.</p>"
