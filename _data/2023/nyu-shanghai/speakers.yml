  bio: "Minsu Park is an Assistant Professor of Social Research and Public Policy at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) and an Affiliate Faculty at the Center for Data Science at New York University (NYU). He works in computational social science with a specialization in the consumption of culture, production of creative work, and social networks. His current research focuses on how informational and normative cues interact with an individual's preference to make a certain decision and how cultural preferences change over time—individually and globally. His research inhabits an interdisciplinary nexus between data science and social science, simultaneously drawing on and contributing to both. His work has been published in top-tier computer and information science conferences (e.g., ICWSM) and interdisciplinary journals (e.g., Nature Human Behaviour)."
