- name: Beatrice Bonini
  bio: "I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Columbia University in the City of New York, where I study public opinion and political economy. Prior to joining Columbia, I earned a B.S. and M.Sc. in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University, where I focused on immigration, voting behavior and populism. I also gained experience in consultancy and in academic research centers in Italy and in the UK. I am currently working on my dissertation project on political communication on social media and (offline vs online) political participation of Millennials and the Gen Z. I am examining (i) whether, and in which ways, political content produced by non-political actors impacts younger generations, their preferences and behaviors and (ii) the trade-offs and incentives that these digital opinion leaders face when “going political”. I will employ different quantitative methods, from causal inference to experimental designs, to text and image analysis. I am also passionate about travelling and I am taking advantage of my time in NYC to travel more around Central America. I am also dedicated to yoga and meditation and eager to improving my surfing skills."

- name: Muhammad Muhammad
  bio: "I am a master’s student in political science at the University of Mannheim. I obtained my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in water and environmental engineering at Cairo University (Egypt), and then obtained my PhD in civil engineering with a focus on water resources at the University of Texas at Austin (USA). I eventually decided to direct and adapt the quantitative analytical skills obtained from my engineering studies to tackling political and societal problems, and I am currently employed as a research assistant at the Mannheim Center for European Social Research (MZES) as part of the PARFORM project (Partnership Formation in the Context of Recent Refugee Migration). In our research we investigate the question of whether the newly arrived refugee migrants in Germany would consider forming partnerships with the majority population? Or would they search for partners in their country of origin, or among the established ethnic minorities? How would members of the majority and from established immigrant groups perceive and react to partnership attempts of newcomers? Finally, when I am not spending time worrying about democratic backsliding or social cohesion in multi-ethnic liberal democracies, I like to read (especially the philosophy of Nietzsche), go cycling, and discover interesting restaurants!"
