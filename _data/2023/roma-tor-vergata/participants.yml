- name: Adrianna Jezierska
  bio: "My name is Adrianna, and I am in the first year of PhD at the University of Bristol, researching online climate-diet discourse of online vegan communities. I am particularly interested in exploring (i) how various actors create opinions on vegan and plant-based diets in the context of climate change and (ii) to what extent they influence their social networks. This project will use a mixed-method approach, including computational social science (NLP, topic modelling), network theory and qualitative interviews. Prior to joining the PhD programme, I earned an MRes in Sustainable Futures from the University of Bristol and a BSc in Marketing from the University of Southampton. I also have a wide-ranging experience in (sci)communications, working previously in public administration for sustainability and climate action, public policy and NGOs. Whilst not at my desk, I enjoy tennis, cooking, long walks in the forest and pilates."

- name: Beatrice Bonini
  bio: "I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Columbia University in the City of New York, where I study public opinion and political economy. Prior to joining Columbia, I earned a B.S. and M.Sc. in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University, where I focused on immigration, voting behavior and populism. I also gained experience in consultancy and in academic research centers in Italy and in the UK. I am currently working on my dissertation project on political communication on social media and (offline vs online) political participation of Millennials and the Gen Z. I am examining (i) whether, and in which ways, political content produced by non-political actors impacts younger generations, their preferences and behaviors and (ii) the trade-offs and incentives that these digital opinion leaders face when “going political”. I will employ different quantitative methods, from causal inference to experimental designs, to text and image analysis. I am also passionate about travelling and I am taking advantage of my time in NYC to travel more around Central America. I am also dedicated to yoga and meditation and eager to improving my surfing skills."

- name: Genevieve Smith
  bio: "Genevieve Smith is a DPhil candidate at Oxford University in the International Development department. Her research explores gender-related impacts and opportunities of artificial intelligence using machine learning (ML). In particular, she focuses on if/how ML-based alternative lending apps in India may reinforce gender inequity in low- and middle-income countries and methods to advance more feminist ML tools. Genevieve holds a Master’s in Development Practice from the University of California, Berkeley and works as the Associate Director at the Center for Equity, Gender & Leadership at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. Here, she examines socio-technical questions of how bias in AI is perpetuated through organizational governance and team structures, as well as how to advance equity and inclusion within teams and technology products. She worked previously with UN Women, the UN Foundation, and the International Center for Research on Women exploring topics of women’s economic empowerment, inclusive technology, and digital inclusion. Genevieve is a Research Affiliate at the Minderoo Centre for Technology & Democracy at Cambridge University.\n Genevieve’s an avid adventurer and can be found skiing, kiteboarding, mountain biking, backpacking or otherwise exploring in her free time!

- name: Lenard
  bio: "Lenard just finished his MSc in Sociology and Social Research at Utrecht University (Netherlands). In his research, he uses networked experiments and social network analysis to study how socio-psychological and sociological mechanisms bring about network dynamics that explain macro phenomena (such as polarization or social cohesion) in groups and markets. Most recently, he has studied the effects of reputation systems on social cohesion in economic interaction. In the fall, he will be starting his PhD in Organizational Behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Lenard also holds a BSc in Information Systems from the University of Munster (Germany)."

- name: Muhammad Muhammad
  bio: "I am a master’s student in political science at the University of Mannheim. I obtained my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in water and environmental engineering at Cairo University (Egypt), and then obtained my PhD in civil engineering with a focus on water resources at the University of Texas at Austin (USA). I eventually decided to direct and adapt the quantitative analytical skills obtained from my engineering studies to tackling political and societal problems, and I am currently employed as a research assistant at the Mannheim Center for European Social Research (MZES) as part of the PARFORM project (Partnership Formation in the Context of Recent Refugee Migration). In our research we investigate the question of whether the newly arrived refugee migrants in Germany would consider forming partnerships with the majority population? Or would they search for partners in their country of origin, or among the established ethnic minorities? How would members of the majority and from established immigrant groups perceive and react to partnership attempts of newcomers? Finally, when I am not spending time worrying about democratic backsliding or social cohesion in multi-ethnic liberal democracies, I like to read (especially the philosophy of Nietzsche), go cycling, and discover interesting restaurants!"

- name: Sara Veronesi
  bio: "Sara is a Master student in Economics at Bocconi University (Milan). Her research interest lies at the intersection between political, behavioral and development economics. In particular, she is now interested in studying the relationship between the increasing salience of divisive political topics in the public debate and the formation and strengthening of stereotypes of disadvantaged groups in Italy. Previously, she worked on a theoretical model that explained how globalization in specific developing countries contexts contributes to the worsening of the already low economic and social progress of women through their higher employment in the grey economy."
