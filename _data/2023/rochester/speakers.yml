  bio: "With over 14 years of experience living and working in the US and Switzerland, I am a seasoned data analytics and computer graphics expert. Since 2004, I have been a Faculty Member at Sabanci University, Istanbul, where I have led and contributed to groundbreaking research in a variety of areas, including behavioral analytics, computational social science, cultural heritage, augmented reality, and visual analytics. In 2006, I founded one of the first data analytics companies, VisioThink, which quickly became a leading player in the industry. As CEO until 2018, I oversaw the development of cutting-edge technologies that helped clients to gain new insights into their data, enabling them to make better decisions and achieve their business goals more effectively. In 2015, I cofounded a research lab on behavioral analytics and visualization together with MIT Media Lab. This lab has fostered strong industry collaboration, enabling us to develop innovative technologies that have helped companies across a range of industries to gain valuable insights into human behavior and social dynamics. I have also advised and acted in the primary investigator role for several international companies, including Ageas Portugal, Tramontina, Turkcell, Akbank, Garanti Bank, Sabancı Holding, SAS, National Insurance Information and Monitoring Center, Aksigorta, Netaş, and SabancıDx. My passion for using technology to understand and improve the world around us is what drives me every day.

  bio: "I am Winship Distinguished Research Professor and Associate Professor in the Departments of English and Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University, where I also direct the Digital Humanities Lab. Before arriving at Emory, I taught in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. I received my PhD in English and American Studies from the CUNY Graduate Center, and my AB in Literature (English and French) from Harvard University. In 2017, I was named one of the “rising stars in digital humanities” from Inside Higher Ed. I am currently at work on two major projects: Data by Design, an interactive history of data visualization from the eighteenth century to the present; and Vectors of Freedom, a quantitative analysis of the abolitionist movement of the nineteenth-century United States. I am the author of two books. The first, Data Feminism (MIT Press), co-authored with Catherine D’Ignazio, offers a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. The second, An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (University of Minnesota Press), shows how thinking about eating can help to tell new stories about the range of people, from the nation’s first presidents to their enslaved chefs, who worked to establish a cultural foundation for the United States. With Matthew K. Gold, I edit Debates in the Digital Humanities (University of Minnesota Press), a hybrid print/digital publication stream that explores debates in the field as they emerge. The most recent book in this series is Debates in the Digital Humanities 2019."
