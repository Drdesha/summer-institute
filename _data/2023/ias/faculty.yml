  bio: Anastasia Menshikova is a PhD student at the Institute for Analytical Sociology in Norrköping, Sweden. Her research focuses on discovering and explaining inequalities, biases, and discriminatory practices using textual digital traces. Besides that, she is interested in social and cultural change - how changes in individual opinions, beliefs and meanings lead to shifts at a collective level. She is generally curious about using computational text analysis to answer sociological questions.
