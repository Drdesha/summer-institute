    - name: Deen Freelon 
      bio: "Deen Freelon is an associate professor at the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media at the University of North Carolina and a principal researcher at the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP). His theoretical interests address how ordinary citizens use social media and other digital communication technologies for political purposes, paying particular attention to how identity characteristics (e.g. race, gender, ideology) influence these uses. Methodologically, he is interested in how computational research techniques can be used to answer some of the most fundamental questions of communication science. Freelon has worked at the forefront of political communication and computational social science for over a decade, coauthoring some of the first communication studies to apply computational methods to social media data. Computer programming lies at the heart of his research practice, which generates novel tools (and sometimes methods) to answer questions existing approaches cannot address. He developed his first research tool, ReCal, as part of his master’s thesis, and it has since been used by tens of thousands of researchers worldwide. His scholarship has been financially supported by grantmakers including the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Spencer Foundation, the Knight Foundation, and the Hewlett Foundation; and published in top-tier journals including Nature, Science, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Freelon earned his Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 2012 and formerly taught at American University in Washington, D.C."

    - name: Danaë Metaxa
      bio: "Danaë Metaxa is an Assistant Professor, primarily appointed in Computer and Information Science with a secondary appointment in Annenberg. Their research interests focus on bias and representation in sociotechnical systems, and the effects of such systems on users in high-stakes social contexts like employment and politics. Danaë’s work has been published and awarded in top-tier publication venues including the Association for Computing Machinery’s (ACM) Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), and the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). They have also worked in an advisory role with legal, industry, and policy  groups including  the NYC Commission on Human Rights, Halt AI, and PolicyLink. Metaxa serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Online Trust and Safety, and has previously been on the CSCW steering committee. In the past, while at Stanford University, Danaë was also a fellow with the McCoy Center for Ethics in Society and a postdoctoral scholar with the Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society. Prior to joining Penn, Danaë received their M.S. and Ph.D. from Stanford University in Computer Science, and joint A.B. degrees from Brown University in Computer Science and Science & Technology Studies."

    - name: Aj Alvero
      bio: "AJ Alvero is a computational sociologist at the University of Florida interested in language, race/ethnicity, culture, and education. His current research leverages computational techniques to analyze college admissions essays and uncover the racial and socioeconomic patterns within them. AJ’s future research plans include investigations into machine translation and multilingualism, social media and counter hate speech, and more investigations into educational systems using data science. He earned his PhD in Education Data Science and the Sociology of Education at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. He also earned an MS from the Department of Statistics and a Graduate Certificate in Computational Social Science. Prior to entering academia, AJ was a high school teacher in Miami, FL."

    - name: Rebbeca Weiss 
      bio: "Rebecca Weiss is an award-winning computational social scientist and data science leader. She has worked in academia and industry, applying innovative methods to large-scale data sets to better understand online environments and their behavioral consequences. As head of research and innovation at Mozilla, she created and incubated the Rally project, a privacy-preserving data platform leveraged by institutions including Princeton, Stanford, and The Markup to conduct research in the public interest. Before that, she founded the Firefox Data Science team and advanced Lean Data Practices as Mozilla’s director of data science. Weiss has held fellowships at the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University and at the Brown Institute for Media Innovation (a joint effort between Stanford School of Engineering and Columbia School of Journalism). She has advised the U.S. Congress on artificial intelligence policy and her research has been published in leading computer science and social science conferences and journals, such as WWW, ICWSM, KDD, PETS, and ICA.  She holds a Ph.D. from Stanford, a S.M. in technology policy from MIT, and a B.A. in cognitive systems from the University of British Columbia."
