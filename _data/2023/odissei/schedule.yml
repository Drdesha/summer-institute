  events:
    - name: "ODISSEI-SICSS is split into two phases. During the first week the participants will be introduced to ODISSEI and taught machine learning in python. This will be primarily done through a course run by the eScience center. They will directly apply this knowledge to worked examples using a consolidated version of the LISS Panel data, with the aim of predicting fertility behavior in the LISS Panel. On Thursday, the participants will be given additional training on analytical methods that they could apply within the benchmarking challenge. On Friday, the participants will work in teams to submit their best prediction model to a benchmarking platform, where their model will be evaluated by the ODISSEI benchmarking team." 
    - name: "At the end of every day during the summer school (except Friday afternoons), there will be a guest speaker who will present their work or a general topic in computational social science to the participants. These talks will last 30-40 mins with 20-30 mins of Q&A."
    - name: "Slides will be added on the [ODISSEI Zenodo Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/odissei/); other material will be shared via GitHub"
    - name: "All course sessions will take place in the Mandeville Building on the Erasmus Campus Woudestein, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam.

  name: "Benchmarking Challenge"
  events: 
    - name: "In the second week , the teams will be given access to the CBS remote access environment and will be able to link the LISS respondents from week 1 to administrative data and extend their models. They will have one week to work in their teams to improve their prediction models from week 1 using this wider range of predictors with the winners announced on the final Friday of the summer school. For this final element of the challenge, teams will not only be assessed by how well their model predicts the outcomes for the LISS respondents, but also the degree to which it predicts fertility behavior in the wider population (i.e. its generalizability)."
