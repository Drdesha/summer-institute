  bio: I am an analytical and computational sociologist currently enrolled in a dual-title Sociology and Social Data Analytics (STEM) Ph.D. program at The Pennsylvania State University. My interests include collective behavior, social complexity, networks, and social cognition. I use agent-based modeling, epidemiological methods, spatial econometrics, and network analysis, among other techniques, to understand (1) how collective behavioral patterns emerge from autonomous, spontaneous interactions, and (2) how things (ideas, norms, behaviors, innovations, products, etc.) spread.
