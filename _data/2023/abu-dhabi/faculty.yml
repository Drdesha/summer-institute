- name: Minsu Park
  bio: Minsu Park is an Assistant Professor of Social Research and Public Policy at New York University Abu Dhabi. He develops and applies quantitative and computational methods to study the consumption and production of creative work. His current projects focus on how cultural artifacts/interests flow worldwide and how social traces, such as ratings, reviews, and reviewer identities, shape audiencesâ€™ perceptions and engagements online. His research inhabits an interdisciplinary nexus between data science and social science, simultaneously drawing on and contributing to both, and has been published in top-tier venues in both computer and information science conferences (e.g., ISMIR, ICWSM) and interdisciplinary journals (e.g., Science Advances, Nature Human Behaviour). He received his doctorate in Information Science at Cornell University, where he was a member of the Social Dynamics Lab. He is also affiliated with the Center for Data Science at New York University.
