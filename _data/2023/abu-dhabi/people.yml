     - name: Mario D. Molina
      bio: Mario is a Postdoctoral Associate in the Social Science Division at New York University Abu Dhabi, and he will start as an assistant professor at NYUAD in the Fall of 2024. He holds a PhD in Sociology from Cornell University, an MA in Sociology from Universidad Catolica de Chile, and a BA in Philosophy from Universidad de los Andes (Chile). His research lies at the interface of economic sociology, social networks, and computational social science. He broadly considers how organizational structures and network dynamics impact beliefs about unequal rewards and prosocial behaviors and the mechanisms that feedback to sustain or disrupt these social systems. His work has appeared in Organization Science, Science Advances, and the Annual Review of Sociology, among other outlets.

    - name: Minsu Park
      bio: Minsu Park is an Assistant Professor of Social Research and Public Policy at New York University Abu Dhabi. He develops and applies quantitative and computational methods to study the consumption and production of creative work. His current projects focus on how cultural artifacts/interests flow worldwide and how social traces, such as ratings, reviews, and reviewer identities, shape audiences’ perceptions and engagements online. His research inhabits an interdisciplinary nexus between data science and social science, simultaneously drawing on and contributing to both, and has been published in top-tier venues in both computer and information science conferences (e.g., ISMIR, ICWSM) and interdisciplinary journals (e.g., Science Advances, Nature Human Behaviour). He received his doctorate in Information Science at Cornell University, where he was a member of the Social Dynamics Lab. He is also affiliated with the Center for Data Science at New York University.
