  bio: "Mark Tunick teaches political theory, ethics, and constitutional law  at FAU’s Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College. He received his Ph.D. in political science from the University of California, Berkeley, and previously taught at Stanford University. Many of his publications apply key figures in the history of political philosophy—Hegel, Kant, Locke, Mill—to topics of current importance such as privacy, punishment, property rights, and the right to bear arms. He is interested in the threat posed to reasonable expectations of privacy by surveillance in public places, the use of facial recognition technologies, and widespread collection of data for later use. Recently he developed an interdisciplinary undergraduate course on ethical issues raised by artificial intelligence such as liability issues of self-driving cars or drones, economic impacts of artificial intelligence, ethical concerns with predictive analytics using big data, and the ethical status of robots."
