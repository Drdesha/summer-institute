  bio: "Natasha Quadlin is an Associate Professor of Sociology at UCLA. Her research examines social inequality in the contemporary United States, with an emphasis on inequality in access and returns to education. She is particularly interested in using large-scale experiments and surveys to examine the mechanisms behind inequalities in schools, families, and labor markets. Other projects use experimental methods to examine public attitudes, and how these attitudes are linked with inequalities on account of gender, social class, race, and other characteristics."
