**Update 3/20/23: SICSS-Sydney has been postponed, and will not take place during summer 2023. Please feel free to apply to other locations for this summer. Apologies for the inconvenience!**

From 19 June to 30 June, 2023, the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/our-research/centres-institutes-and-groups/sydney-social-sciences-and-humanities-advanced-research-centre/research/computational-social-science-lab.html) and the [Sydney Social Sciences and Humanities Advanced Research Centre](https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/our-research/centres-institutes-and-groups/sydney-social-sciences-and-humanities-advanced-research-centre.html) will host the Institute in Computational Social Science to be held at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au), Australia. The purpose of the Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

We invite applications from PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and early career faculty within 5 years of PhD conferral. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently underrepresented in computational social science. SICSS-Sydney aims to select around 25 participants, all of whom are expected to fully attend the entire two-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2023/sydney/apply) should be received by **30 March, 2023**. For inquiries, contact sicss.admin@sydney.edu.au
