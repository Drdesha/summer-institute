Summer Institute in Computational Social Science - Istanbul will be sponsored by Ozyegin University, and will be co-supported by Koc, Sabanci and Bogazici Universities. The first phase of SICSS-Istanbul will be an online-only 'pre-SICSS bootcamp' (19-28 June), which will focus on providing a coding, programming and reading background to prepare participants. The second phase - 'actual SICSS' - will be held from 3-14 July at Ozyegin University. 

The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early-career faculty members actively working on themes, topics and methods in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data/computer scientists (broadly conceived). The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who are leaders in the field and come from a variety of backgrounds, such as academia, industry, and government. 

Topics covered include Text Analysis, Network Analysis, Web Scraping, Geo-Spatial Data Analysis, Image Analysis ve Ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released as open source. 

Participation is restricted to graduate students, postdocs, and early career researchers. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire program, including all days, all exercises and all projects.

Ozyegin University has generously provided dormitories for participants from outside Istanbul or Turkey. Due to funding limitations, this year we are unable to offer travel grants or reimbursements.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2023/istanbul/apply) are due February 17.
