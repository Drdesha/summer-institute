From June 11 to June 17, 2023, the National Science Foundation will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at Syracuse University. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science and the humanities. The Summer Institute is for social scientists (broadly conceived), data scientists (broadly conceived), and humanists (broadly conveived) alike.

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include investigating issues of race, gender, or systemic social and economic inequality through computational approaches such as data justice, ethics, textual analysis, and machine learning. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Graduate students (Masters and PhDs) and early career scholars from many different racial/ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds with various levels of skills in computational social science are encouraged to apply. SICSS-Syracuse aims to empower prospective participants who are traditionally underrepresented in the field of computational social science, including women and members of other minoritized communities, including different racial/ethnic groups, Indigenous individuals, immigrants, queer persons, and people with disabilities. About 10 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire one-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2023/template/apply) are due March 3rd, 2023.
