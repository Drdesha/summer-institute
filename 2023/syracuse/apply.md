# Apply

## Eligibility
SICSS-Syracuse seeks to provide free training to graduate students (Masters and PhDs) and early career scholars from many different racial/ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds with various levels of skills in computational social science. SICSS-Syracuse aims to empower prospective participants who are traditionally underrepresented in the field of computational social science, including women and members of other minoritized communities, including different racial/ethnic groups, Indigenous individuals, immigrants, queer persons, and people with disabilities. About 10 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists and humanists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be invited to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less coding experience will be encouraged to complete an online SICSS boot camp. Students doing this preparatory work can reach out to the Summer Institute organizers during the two months before the Institute for further assistance.

SICSS-Syracuse will be hosted in person at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. Priority will be given to applicants from Syracuse University and nearby Central New York universities from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: (1) Emphasis on commitment to inclusiveness, diversity, equity, and accessibility; (2) Interest in contributing to social progress and justice; (3) Likelihood to benefit from participation in the institute; (4) Likelihood to contribute to the learning experience of other participants; (5) Interest in working collaboratively on research projects. 

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum two pages) describing your current research, your interest in computational social science, why you want to attend SICSS, and how you (plan to) contribute to social progress and justice through your work, and (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing your contributions.

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by March 3rd, 2023.** All application materials must be submitted through the following [**Google Form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTvF3lhkVD6LJucRBpMPP5GahNabs9KyVGQpPongOuCHJxAQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail by May 12th, 2023, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter. 

Inquiries can be sent to Dr. Martina Santia (msantia@syr.edu).

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Syracuse, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Syracuse if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
