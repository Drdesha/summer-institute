# Pre-arrival

The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields and backgrounds. In order to use our time together efficiently, there are a number of things that you should do before participating in SICSS-NYU Silver 2023.

- Complete the pre-read
- Complete the coding tutorial for Python (if needed)
- Complete coding bootcamp for R (if needed)
- Watch lecture videos
- Prepare your computing environment

Teaching assistants will host office hours through Slack to support you as you work through these pre-arrival materials.

## Reading

In order to prepare for SICSS-NYU Silver 2023, you should read Matt Salganikâ€™s book, *[Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com)* ([Read online](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/) or purchase from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Social-Research-Digital-Age/dp/0691158649), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bit-by-bit-matthew-salganik/1125483924), [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780691158648), or [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691196107/bit-by-bit)). Parts of this book, which is a broad introduction to computational social science, will be review for most of you, but if we all read this book ahead of time, then we can use our time together for more advanced topics.

You can find a list of additional readings to help you with understanding computational social science on this page, [Awesome Computational Social Science](https://github.com/gesiscss/awesome-computational-social-science#books).



## Coding Tutorial for Python

The [Coding Tutorial for Python by Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) is an online tutorial created by Mike Dane to provide you with beginner level skills in coding so that you can follow the more advanced curriculum we teach at SICSS. It provides a well-rounded introduction into Python.

If you would like more practice after completing the tutorial, some other materials that we can recommend are:
- _[Introducing Python](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492051365/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&aaxitk=6c4766d2757dd35661e9002d793683a4&hsa_cr_id=4400412870801&pd_rd_plhdr=t&pd_rd_r=f1a37283-04c1-41d7-9634-596ab888ffe9&pd_rd_w=sYTAF&pd_rd_wg=OhQ70&ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_mcd_asin_0_title)_ by Bill Lubanovic
- _[Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)_, Taught by Jake VanderPlas at University of Washington. This book includes tutorials, coding (notebooks), and assignments.
- [Real Python - Data science tutorials](https://realpython.com/tutorials/data-science/), a website that provides several resources using Python for multiple tasks used for data analysis.
- _[Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/1492041130/ref=sr_1_13?crid=RDL2XZ5R5GED&keywords=oreilly+python+for+data+analysis&qid=1641419922&sprefix=oreilly+python+for+data+analysis%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-13)_ by Joel Grus
- [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3), Code Academy.


## Lecture videos

SICSS-NYU Silver 2023 will be using a [flipped classroom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom). Therefore, you should watch (some) [videos of lectures](https://sicss.io/curriculum) before our meetings, and then we will use our time together for discussion and group activities. More information will be provided later.

## Computing environment

### Programming
### Python

Some of the activities will require coding, and we will support Python. You are welcome to use other languages, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them. We are going to use the online environment tool, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to code and compile the  notebooks. Although we do not require it for the institute, you could install [Python, Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to code on your local computer. 

### Slack

Before participating at SICSS-NYU Silver 2023, you should have an account in the SICSS 2023 Slack workspace. If you have not used Slack before, you should review these [getting started](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started) materials. Slack can be hard to use at first, but we've found that it is the best way to enable everyone to collaborate.

### GitHub

Many participants at SICSS use GitHub to collaborate. If you do not yet have one, you should [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If you are a student, we recommend that you apply for a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

## Office hours

The SICSS-NYU Silver 2023 [organizers](https://sicss.io/2023/nyu-nyc/people#teaching_assistants) will host office hours in the SICSS 2023 Slack. You can find information about the office hours in the SICSS 2023 Slack channel at #sicss-nyu-silver.
