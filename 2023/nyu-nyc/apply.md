# Apply

## Eligibility

We invite applications from graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D., who are able to attend the program in-person in New York City. SICSS-NYU Silver is committed to diversity and inclusion in computational social science, and we welcome applicants from groups currently underrepresented in computational social science. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 20 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together people interested in computational social science across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience in social science research will be provided with additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding and computational applications will be provided with a set of online learning modules on Python or R programming languages. Courses will be mostly taught in Python. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the Institute.

We will evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science; 2) contributions to social good, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others; 3) likelihood to benefit from participation; 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants; 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we will account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by March 31, 2023 at 11:59pm EST.**

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-NYU, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-NYU if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.

#### Will travel or lodging be provided at the SICSS-NYU Silver site?

No. Applicants who work or study in the New York metropolitan area will be prioritized for the SICSS-NYU Silver program. However, those who are qualified and willing to pay for their own travel and living expenses during the program will be considered. All participants are expected to attend in-person for the full 9 days of the program.
