From June 19 to June 30, 2023, the National Science Foundation and Wilkes Honors College will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at the MacArthur Campus of Florida Atlantic University in the seaside community of Jupiter. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

SICSS participants are generally graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty. In SICSS-South Florida, we will consider advanced undergraduates as well.  Among faculty applicants, preference will be given to those who are not yet tenured and/or are within 7 years of the receipt of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20-25 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

[Application materials](https://forms.gle/hSXnqDKHDcAqv38f7) are now due by Monday, March 13, 2023, at 11:59 ET.
