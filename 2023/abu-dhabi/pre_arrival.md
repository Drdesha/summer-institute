# Pre-arrival

The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields and backgrounds. In order to use our time together efficiently, there are a number of things that you should do before participating in SICSS-Abu Dhabi.

- Complete the pre-institute readings
- Complete coding bootcamp (if needed)
- Prepare your computing environment

TAs will host office hours through Slack to support you as you work through these pre-arrival materials.

## Reading

In order to prepare for SICSS-Abu Dhabi, we recommend reading Matt Salganikâ€™s book, *[Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com)* ([Read online](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/) or purchase from [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780691158648), [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691196107/bit-by-bit)), or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Social-Research-Digital-Age/dp/0691158649), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bit-by-bit-matthew-salganik/1125483924). Parts of this book, which is a broad introduction to computational social science, will be review for most of you, but if we all read this book ahead of time, then we can use our time together for more advanced topics.

## Coding Boot Camp

The [SICSS Boot Camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp) is an online training program created by Chris Bail to provide you with beginner level skills in coding so that you can follow the more advanced curriculum we teach at SICSS. The videos and materials are designed for complete beginners and are best viewed as a sequence since each video builds upon content introduced in previous tutorials. If you are already familiar with the topics in these videos, you do not need to complete them.

If you would like more practice after completing the Boot Camp videos, some other materials that we can recommend are:
- [Python for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) or [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) for those who have never used Python before or wish to refresh their knowledge on the programming language.
- [Introduction to Computational Social Science methods with Python](https://github.com/gesiscss/css_methods_python) and [Data Science from Scratch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/) both cover the basics of using Python for computation social science research, including data wrangling using Pandas, web scraping, network analysis, machine learning, etc.
- For those who wish to learn more about machine learning and deep learning, we recommend [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).

Please note that the majority of the coding work presented at SICSS-Abu Dhabi will employ Python. You are welcome to employ a language of your choice, such as R, Julia, or other languages that are commonly used by computational social scientists.  However, we cannot support those languages.


## Computing environment

### Python

Some of the activities will require coding, and we will support Python. You are welcome to use other languages, but we cannot guarantee that we can support them. Before SICSS you should install a modern, stable-release version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install). If you are looking for an environment management tool to keep your libraries organized, we recommend [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).


### Slack

Before participating at SICSS-Abu Dhabi, you should have an account in the SICSS Slack workspace.  If you have not used Slack before, you should review these [getting started](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started) materials.  Slack can be hard to use at first, but we've found that it is the best way to enable everyone to collaborate.

### GitHub

Many participants at SICSS use GitHub to collaborate. If you do not yet have one, you should [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If you are a student, we recommend that you apply for a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
