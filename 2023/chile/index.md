From July 17 to July 27, 2023, the Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data (IMFD), the National Center For Artificial Intelligence (CENIA), the Computer Science Department of the University of Chile, and the Institute of Sociology of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (ISUC) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at the Pontificia Universidad Católica, Campus San Joaquín. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include:

* ethics
* data collection 	
* machine learning
* text as data
* image as data
* surveys in the digital age
* network science
* Visualization tools 
* digital field experiments 
* mass collaboration
				
There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to graduate students (master and doctoral programs), postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. In exceptional situations, we may accept applications from undergraduate students who are concluding their degree and intend to pursue a postgraduate program in a related field.  We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

[Application materials](https://sicss.io/2023/chile/apply) are due April 28, 2023 at 23:59 CLT.
