# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation was restricted to masters and doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers and researchers working outside of academia. However, there were no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study or country of employment. 15 participants have been invited.

The Summer Institute aimed to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research were expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience in coding were expected to complete SICSS boot camp. Students doing this preparatory work have been supported by a teaching assistant who held online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcomed applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluated applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) creative and critical perspectives in computational social science 3) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public dataset and creating educational opportunities for others 4) likelihood to benefit from participation 5) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 6) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. We were also keen on applicants who have an interest in Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D). Further, when making our evaluations, we attempted to account for an applicant's career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-JIAS, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-JIAS if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once.
