<h2 class="display-4">Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2022 Post-mortem</h2>

**Published on:** October 3, 2022

We’ve just completed the 2022 [Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/). The purpose of the Summer Institutes is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institutes are for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). This summer we had a mixture of in-person institutes and virtual institutes across the world. In addition to [SICSS-Duke](#duke), which was organized by Chris Bail, there were 31 partner locations run by SICSS alumni.

The purpose of this document is to describe a) what we did, b) what we think worked well, and c) what we will do differently next time. We hope that this will be useful to other people organizing similar Summer Institutes. If you are interested in hosting a partner location of SICSS 2023 at your university, company, NGO, or governmental organization, please read our information for [potential partner locations](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/host).

This document includes post-mortem reports from all of our locations in order to facilitate comparisons. As you will see, different sites did things differently, and we think that this kind of customization was an important part of how we were successful.

<h2 class="display-4" id="amu-law">SICSS-AMU/Law</h2>

We’ve divided the post-mortem into 5 parts: 1) outreach and application process, 2) pre-arrival and onboarding, 3) the first week, 4) the second week (group projects) and 5) post-departure.

### 1. Outreach and application process

As the first SICSS in Poland, the SICSS-AMU/Law was quite challenging. That is because, we had to create the whole concept of the institute including a schedule, invitations, social media descriptions, graphics, and essential documentation. There were some tasks that we had to do together with double-checking, as the main description, which could be the base for further content. In the other tasks, like creating content on social media we were supported by students. However, even in advertising, there is always the kind of work that you cannot completely commit to students, as you are the most informed person about your project.

Our plan was to gather young scientists from Poland and surrounding countries through a broad advertising campaign and e-mail. Primarily, the traditional way of promotion through the University website, Facebook and some basic mailing didn't work. That is why we had to move the deadline to at least a month later. The result of brainstorming was that we had to run a paid advertisement and do some massive mailing. Going after the other locations, we tried to keep our Facebook fan page constantly up to date with regular news on speakers, schedules, interesting articles and the team. The information about the event was also disseminated on topical groups of scientific events, conferences and seminars. These traditional methods were supported with paid advertisement, targeted according to the criteria that we declared to consider in the application process. The whole content that we created on Facebook was also used on LinkedIn, however with little success.

As mentioned, we intensified also mailing as it is the only direct channel of communication with potential candidates. For that purpose, we created a database of e-mail addresses from selected countries based on publicly available sites. It turned out to be a huge volume of work, as we decided to copy individual addresses not only these of secretaries, institutes, chairs, and other offices. Probably we couldn't have done it without great support from students. In the effect, for three weeks we have sent around 15.000 e-mails with invitations to the Institute.

As a result, we received 50 applications ranging from China to the US and Europe. That was enough to run an institute and make some selections. In order to select participants we used the following criteria: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open-source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants, and 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we accounted for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities. An extremely important factor for us was the time zone. After some discussion, we decided to give a chance also to participants from Asia. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a mistake as after a few days they had to resign. A factor that was eventually hard to assess is digital skills. We encountered some applications that mentioned explicitly full possession of Windows/Microsoft Office and other software skills. This could have been an indicator that the applicant may acquire proficiency in other software quickly. However, this was not the case. Programming requires slightly different skills than those learned through extensive usage of office software.

What is important is to accept more people than planned. Primarily, we wanted to have 30 participants. Of the 35 accepted, only half confirmed participation. For that reason, we invited the next 10 people. Finally, on the first day of the institute, we had around 20 participants, with 15 that managed to finish. The other problem we had was the first deadline that we had to move at least a month because of an insufficient number of applications. It was, however, before massive mailing and paid Facebook campaign that we regard as the most efficient.

### 2. Pre-arrival and onboarding

To the selected group that confirmed their participation, various resources were indicated. First of all a book by Matt Salganik “Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age” was recommended. Second, SICSS regular boot camp (videos) was suggested. Third, we pointed out that special SICSS-AMU/Law Boot Camp would be available a week before the Institute.

Although the information was spread via e-mail and the Institute’s website, it seems that the resources did not enjoy much attention. In particular, the participants did not experience extensively the exclusive boot camp that took three evenings via Zoom. There could be various reasons for that, one of them being limited possession of coding skills, as the first (of three) boot camp workshops was considerably more frequented than the next ones. It is possible, some participants were discouraged with the amount of coding to face.

As the next days showed, the participants could have better familiarized themselves with SICSS videos that covered many of the issues that came when starting to write in R. It seems, that the practical aspect of the school was not obvious for some participants that were (positively) surprised with the number of exercise and programming tasks. This, however, does not mean they were well-prepared to deal with them with ease. Perhaps, a clearer message on that issue could have helped in better understanding of the Institute and skills needed.

We encountered no abundant correspondence regarding organizational matters. As it was pointed out, we received limited response from the candidates accepted to the Institute. Among those who confirmed, there were a few that either did not show up at all or quit after day 0 (virtual get-together) or day 1. We received no contact from them. In such cases it might be good to get in touch and learn about their motives (which can be either personal or due to the Institute’s agenda). We felt, however, that those people took seats from those who wanted to participate but were refused admission due to the maximum number of participants reached.

### 3. The first week

We began the first week with a virtual get-together on Sunday evening. We abandoned a traditional introductory round, during which every person says a few words about herself/himself. Instead, we launched a Kahoot quiz and asked for their motivation, background etc. In addition, we made two short (ca. 10-minute long) speed dating sessions in breakout rooms (3 persons in each room) with random allocation of participants.

We followed the traditional framework of the two-week SICSS, meaning that the first week was a mix of lectures and group activities. The day started between 12:00-13:00 and lasted until 17:30-18:30. This was supposed to allow the participants to catch up with their professional and personal responsibilities in the morning and/or read the handouts before the group exercises. In addition, this was supposed to mitigate the Zoom fatigue.

Typically, the guest lecture lasted 1,5 hours whilst group exercises took 2,5 hours. In addition, we allocated approximately one hour for brown-bag lunches in the Zoom breakout rooms, where participants were invited to discuss their ideas for the 2nd week's projects. The latter proved successful as we had two groups established already in the first week (the third group was established in the 2nd week). Brown-bag lunches arguably contributed to the positive group dynamic as most participants stayed online for the whole time and took the opportunity to get to know each other better. At the end of the day, we had a 30-minutes long wrap-up which was sufficient to summarize the exercises and remind about the reading assignments for tomorrow.

The main focus of our Institute was law, however, from the very beginning, we aimed to recruit participants with diverse background. This also meant that the topics, guest speakers, and exercises had to be law-related and at the same time accessible to non-lawyers. Therefore, we covered the following topics: 1) natural language processing, 2) prediction and classification, 3) online survey design, 4) experimental methods in law, and 5) plotting maps. Most participants decided to apply NLP methods in the second week, which suggests that this topic could be assigned at least one additional day. Most of the guest speakers shared their presentations and R code (posted on Slack) which were then extensively used by the participants. One of the lectures was programming-free and focused on the general issues related to computational social sciences (e.g., why a social scientist should learn programming) and turned out to be a great success for at least two reasons. Firstly, it arrived on Wednesday evening when the participants were exhausted with programming (and some of them contesting their ability to learn computational methods). Secondly, the meeting was run in an informal Q&A setting, which created a very comfortable environment.

Group exercises followed a structure where participants were split into smaller groups to work together on activities (which are all posted on our website and Slack). The exercises were programming-oriented and consisted of smaller tasks. Out of five tasks, participants were able to complete between 1 and 3, which induced us to implement the following changes starting from Day 3:

1. Introduce additional TAs during the group exercises.
2. Release the answers with annotated code gradually during the exercises.
3. Structure the exercises as follows: 30-minutes session in the breakout rooms and 15-mins plenary session, during which one of the programmers explained how to deal with a specific task.

The participants welcomed all these changes.

As most participants struggled with the basics of R programming, we have been thinking about some backup solutions. We decided to introduce two optional workshops on Orange Data Mining software which attracted ca. 70% of the participants. The software is based on Python, however, it provides an intuitive GUI. Most participants utilized Orange in the second week and performed at least an initial exploratory data analysis before moving to R.

### 4. The second week (group projects)

During the SICSS-AMU/Law, three groups were formed, each one realized one project. The participants mixed with each other in a very interesting way. The first group was mainly economic in nature and dealt with _IMF discourse change and continuity after covid19-pandemic._ The second group was of a mixed, legal-economic nature, and carried out the project _Transformation of EU's internal market._ The third group was purely legal and dealt with the project _Prediction of derogation of legal act basing on duration of vacatio legis._

From the substantive point of view, the topics of the projects were very interesting and well-thought-out. Basically, the research could be continued and probably could end up with successful publications, because the conclusions already presented during the SICSS were really promising.

From the programming point of view, all groups faced similar problems. Both, during the projects and during the workshops (in the first week). Participants were generally very inattentive and made a lot of typos. As a result, correctly written code did not work, which is very frustrating and, unfortunately, can be daunting. Another problem was misunderstanding the data structure and trying to write code without a plan. Unfortunately, this cannot be done. The programmer should have got a clear idea to write a program. Otherwise, the effects will be dissatisfactory. Such problems could be avoided if the participants took part in the general boot camp as well as in our extended one. Unfortunately, everyone openly admitted that they neglected this help. One solution could be to organize a mandatory boot camp for participants. After all, it is difficult to understand why the participants avoided using the materials provided to them (where the answers to most of their problems were found) and the R-documentation.

One of the strongest points of the projects was definitely the use of R at a satisfactory level by some groups. If the group did choose to use R, they did it quite well. The use of Orange can be indicated as a contrast. This is the tool that many participants have used, and this is the wrong way to go.

The groups hesitantly reached for the help of internet materials (Stack Overflow) or the extended boot camp provided by us. Definitely, this is good news, however, it was done rather inaccurately and superficially, which resulted in analyses of low quality. The ambition was also a big problem, the participants wanted more than they were able to do. However, considering that SICSS is an educational event, the confidence and ambition of the participants must be considered a success, even if projects suffered because of this.

It was clear that the closer to the deadline (Friday in the second week), the more intensified the work. Throughout the whole institute, TAs were available on duty hours every day, which did not meet with great interest. The exception was last Thursday, when there was a line of people willing to ask questions and get help. This is an area for improvement, perhaps it would be better to cancel duty hours, especially during the second week, and instead of this, make TAs supervisors of groups. One TA for one group.

The collaboration within the groups was particularly good. Members used two channels of communication. Most of the discussions took place via Slack chat. Sometimes, when needed, the participants organized video meetings at Zoom.

Using Slack as the main communication channel was a very good idea, even the free version was sufficient. The second channel of communication, more direct, was Zoom. To simplify usage and avoid problems, we organized every meeting and duty hour under the same link. Maybe one software for both chat and video meetings is a nice idea for improvement.

Participation in lectures from other locations was minor. The curriculum of SICSS-AMU/Law was very intense, so attending other lectures could be too hard. Nevertheless, such possibility requires more advertising.

### 5. Post-departure

The Institute was concluded in a friendly atmosphere with a noticeable vibe of success among those who made the biggest progress coding-wise. We encouraged the participants to continue using Slack as a platform to further develop their ideas, share information about grants or projects and network. We also suggested joining the SICSS world community to reach out to the broader group of scientists who apply computational methods in their work. We provided participants with personal certificates of completion of the Institute.

A good idea to monitor the execution of the Institute was to run short online surveys on Google Forms (anonymously). The participants were eager to answer them which helped make changes in week 1 as well as evaluate our work throughout the whole event.

According to the three surveys executed during the Institute, all presentations given by invited speakers enjoyed high or very high scores from participants. Despite the whole event being online, we noted that students “definitely made some connection with other participants” (70% of answers). A similar percentage declared that the schedule of the classes on a daily basis was well planned (67%) while some argued that they should start either earlier or later during the day. A very promising number of the participants (85%) responded that they loved working on a group project and even more of them (92%) declared that they are definitely going to further explore computational methods in their work. This surprisingly corresponds with answers we received after the first days of the Institute. When asked about the technical challenges of coding (including both very code writing as well as installation of various software and libraries) students' opinions were divided. Around 36% of participants declared they clearly expected such challenges. Nearly as many said they did not really expect that many technical difficulties, but expected some. There were single voices that having to deal with such computer challenges was a surprise. This all corresponds with an issue clearly brought in the interim survey, being little coding skills and not enough support from the institute regarding coding fundamentals, according to some of the participants. As it was suggested earlier, a clearer approach should have been taken by our organizing team, i.e. whether we take responsibility and teach the absolute basics or we assume that it is up to the participants to bring certain computer skills to the table.

We accepted with gratitude the feedback from participants who kept saying that there were two best things about the Institute: people (open-minded, enthusiastic and cooperative) and the possibility to grow (learning new research methods, and programming). We note that this was possible not only thanks to the support and funding from various institutions and thanks to highly-involved participants. We believe that this was achieved also by a committed group of organizers who looked out for each other and worked as one team, often beyond “working hours”.

### Programme design

To design the program, we relied on the experiences of our two main organizers (Jana Lasser and Ivan Smirnov), who had either already organized a SICSS location (Ivan, HSE, 2021) or participated in one (Jana, Helsinki, 2021). We designed the programme alongside our strengths and research interests as computational social scientists and invited external speakers to bring diversity and fill in gaps. This included lectures offering a critical perspective on the state of the field of CSS, publishing CSS research and common pitfalls in CSS research projects as well as hands-on lectures on how to use APIs to collect data, how to run large-scale surveys on Amazon Mechanical turk and how to leverage large language models for CSS research. These lectures were complemented by two lectures by our senior organizers: an introduction to networks for CSS research from Markus Strohmaier and a lecture on how to combine large-scale surveys with digital trace data by David Garcia. We were also fortunate to welcome Suhem Parack to give us an introduction to using the Twitter API v2 to collect data for CSS research. Since both main organizers mainly work with Python, we decided to commit to teaching our SICSS location completely in Python, aiming to contribute teaching materials in Python to the collection of teaching materials of SICSS.

Since both main organizers mainly work with Python, we decided to commit to teaching our SICSS location completely in Python, aiming to contribute teaching materials in Python to the collection of teaching materials of SICSS.

**Venue**
Our SICSS location was funded by a funding programme of TU Graz, dedicated to fund online teaching activities that are collaboratively hosted by two universities - in our case RWTH Aachen and TU Graz. We, therefore, planned our programme to take place completely online. We designed the outline of our programme similar to other SICSS locations, planning for one week of lectures and hands-on exercises, followed by one week of group project work with talks by guest lecturers in the evenings to have a common event every day.

### Before the summer school

**Outreach**
We specifically advertised our SICSS location within our two host universities TU Graz and RWTH Aachen, since we wanted to attract students from the Computational Social Systems master’s programme at both universities. We, therefore, advertised the summer school in short pitches in relevant lectures during the winter semester and through mailing lists of lecturers and students of the master’s programme. In addition, we advertised our location over social media channels (Twitter and LinkedIn) as well as over the main SICSS website.

**Applications**
We attracted a total of 71 applications. Students had to submit an academic CV and a motivation letter (1 page), describing their motivation to participate in our SICSS location and the potential benefit for their study and research career. We required no prior programming skills and no specific disciplinary background to apply. Students needed to have at least a bachelor’s degree to apply to our location. We also decided not to ask for recommendation letters. We believe that recommendation letters impose a disproportionate burden on students while there is little evidence of their usefulness.

We aimed to admit 40 students, with guaranteed spots for students from TU and KFU Graz and RWTH Aachen in case they meet the minimum requirements and submit a complete application. We received a total of 5 applications from TU Graz and 3 from RWTH Aachen. The rest of the applications came from students enrolled at other universities. We also received a number of applications from PostDocs or people that had left academia. Given the choice of admitting a student or a non-student with similarly strong application materials, we decided to admit the student, since we felt they would benefit more from our summer school. We also paid special attention to applicants from groups that are underrepresented in CSS.

We invited a total of 40 students to participate in our SICSS location. The disciplinary backgrounds of the people admitted to our location were very diverse, including students from political science (7), computer science (6), social science (5), psychology (5), computational social science (4), economics (3), collective intelligence (2) and physics, statistics, linguistics, data science, geography, engineering, journalism, and genders studies (1 student each). Similarly, the country of residence of our students was very diverse, with the rather high prevalence of German (8) and Austrian (5) students reflecting our increased outreach efforts in these countries, followed by the US (5), Morocco (3), UK (2), Russia (2) and Italy, South Africa, China, Portugal, Denmark, Switzerland, Argentina, Turkey, Korea, Belgium, France, Serbia, Greece and Iran (1 student each). Gender identities were almost balanced, with 22 participants identifying as male, 17 as female, and 1 as non-binary. Rejection rates were similarly balanced, with 52% of the rejected participants identifying as male, 45% as female, and 3% as neither.

**Python crash course**
We did not require any previous (Python) programming knowledge to enroll in our summer school. To get everybody up-to-speed regarding programming in Python, we offered a voluntary two-week Python crash course in the month before our summer school. The course consisted of a curated collection of online learning materials, tailored to fit the needs of participants in our summer school with introductions to general programming in Python (first week) and introductions to the libraries pandas, networkx, statsmodels and matplotlib in the second week. The Python crash course was supervised by two of our teaching assistants, Moritz Erlacher and Florian Hofer, who contributed a great deal of experience in teaching beginner-level programming courses in Python. Since we were aware that our participants had other study or work commitments in the month leading up to the summer school, we designed the Python crash course to be mainly self-paced learning with videos and exercises in Jupyter Notebooks. We offered office hours in the early mornings and late afternoons to help with questions regarding the exercises. The crash course was greatly appreciated by our participants and helped to equilibrate the level of programming skills across our participants at least a bit.

**Onboarding**
In addition to the Python crash course, we pointed students to the online learning materials provided by SICSS and asked them to apply for academic access to the Twitter API. We provided a guide on how to apply for academic access within the scope of our summer school, which was greatly appreciated by students. A total of 33 students applied for academic access and 6 of these applications were denied for unknown reasons.

### During the summer school

**Instruction week**
During the instruction week, we usually started with one lecture of 60-90 minutes at 9:30, followed by one hands-on exercise or group discussion for 90-120 minutes. We made sure to provide breaks of 10 minutes every 45-60 minutes since student feedback indicated that in the online setting it was often not easy to follow instructions for extended blocks of time. After a lunch break of 60 minutes, we had another lecture of 60-90 minutes, followed by a hands-on exercise of 90 minutes and a group discussion of 15-20 minutes to wrap up the day. We asked students for feedback every day, asking them “what did you like about today’s sessions” and “what could be improved”? We received very helpful comments and ideas on how to improve online collaboration from the students, which we tried to implement on the following day. Students indicated that they greatly appreciated that their feedback was promptly incorporated into our location’s organization. We also received a lot of very positive feedback, which was very uplifting to read when preparing the sessions for the next day.

On Friday afternoon we hosted a brainstorming session of 2x60 minutes in random groups of four students each to generate project ideas. Students had to provide an idea title, short description, and responsible person for follow-up questions. This generated a total of 34 ideas. Students could then indicate their interest in working on one of these projects, with the aim of forming project groups of 3-4 students each for the project work in the following week.

**Project week**
We matched people into groups over the weekend between the instruction and project week and students could start working on their projects on Monday morning. We asked them to self-organize their working schedule during the project week, indicating that we expected approximately 5 hours of project work every day. The matching resulted in a total of 10 project groups. We split the supervision of the project groups between the two main lecturers such that each lecturer was responsible for supervising 5 groups. We asked groups to have daily check-ins of ~20 minutes every day. During these check-ins we met the groups in a video chat and helped them with a clearer definition of their research objectives and methods as well as methodological issues. In addition to the daily supervision check-ins, we provided programming support by teaching assistants, who offered office hours in the mornings and afternoons to help with programming questions. Projects were presented on the last day of the summer school. Every group had 10 minutes to present what they worked on plus five minutes of questions.

**Guest speakers**
We invited a total of 8 guest speakers to host lectures, talks, and tutorials during our summer school.

- Anna Di Natale hosted a [hands-on tutorial](https://github.com/JanaLasser/SICSS-aachen-graz/blob/main/02_02_MTurk/SICCSS_MTurk_slides.pdf) on how to use Amazon Mechanical Turk to design and run surveys on day 2.
- Max Pellert hosted a [hands-on tutorial](https://github.com/JanaLasser/SICSS-aachen-graz/blob/main/01_02_digital_trace_data/exercise/gdp_foi_tutorial.ipynb) on how to use digital trace data to answer CSS questions on day 1 and another tutorial on how to leverage large language models for sentiment and emotion classification on day 3.
- David Garcia gave a [lecture](https://dgarcia-eu.github.io/SICSS-2022/#1) on “Combining surveys and big data” on day 3.
- Markus Strohmaier gave a [lecture](https://github.com/JanaLasser/SICSS-aachen-graz/blob/main/03_02_networks/introduction_to_networks_in_CSS.pdf) on “Introduction to networks in CSS” on day 3.
- Suhem Parack gave a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZMNM-dyvk&feature=youtu.be) on how to use the Twitter v2 API.
- Chris Bail gave a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1MDoVXkIBQ&feature=youtu.be) on “New Platforms for Studying Social Media & Polarization”
- Roberta Sinatra gave a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_ZW_pvZY08&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=JanaLasser) on “Quantifying the dynamics of impact in science and art”
- Alina Arseniev-Koehler gave a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00OJj0Ny2XQ&ab_channel=JanaLasser) on “Integrating Topic Modeling and Word Embedding to Characterize Violent Deaths”

When inviting our guest speakers, we tried to showcase cool research by young scholars in our field, as well as provide lectures on foundational aspects of CSS research by established researchers that complemented our lectures. We made sure that each guest lecturer had ample time for Q&A with the students and enjoyed lively discussions after the talks.

**Social activities**

Next to the lectures, exercises, and project work, our student assistant Alina Kopkow organized voluntary social activities to give students the opportunity to get to know each other and the lectures in a non-work context.

On the Sunday evening before the summer school started we organized an informal meet-and-greet with crowd-sourced questions. This event was appreciated by our students and about half of the registered participants showed up.

On the second day of the summer school we organized an online pub-quiz where students could win a copy of either “Bit by Bit” or “Everybody lies”. We had three student teams with three to four students each competing for the prize. The activity was a lot of fun but we felt that more online activities after a long day of online lectures and exercises are not optimal.

At the end of the first week, we organized a hybrid treasure hunt in Graz and Aachen with “agents” on the ground walking through the two cities to find clues and online teams to solve riddles. Only two participants showed up for our treasure hunt and we, therefore, scrapped the group in Graz and only ran the one in Aachen. While the concept of the treasure hunt worked and is a good way to show online students around the city it was definitely too much after a full week of online lectures.

In addition to these activities, we organized a Twitter list for all participants and lecturers of SICSS Aachen Graz to follow each other and network after the summer school. This was greatly appreciated and almost all of our participants are part of this list.

### Logistics

**Finances**
We received a grant of 15,000€ from TU Graz to organize a “joint online course”. We used this money to hire four student assistants to help with the python programming crash course, python programming support during the summer school, and the organization of social activities. In addition, we paid honoraria of 500€ per lecture to our external speakers from these funds. Since our location was run completely online, we did not need funds for student accommodation or food. Initially, we wanted to compensate our two main organizers for their efforts as well, but this was not possible with these funds.

**Communication**
Our main communication channel during the summer school was the SICSS Slack platform. There, we created one main channel for our location, and two additional channels, one for programming support and one to collect links to useful information. In addition, we sent all important information and reminders for lectures by invited speakers over email.

### Logistics

**Social aspects of online learning & interaction**
Our course was organized completely online to accommodate students from different locations. While this was very useful to attract many students from different locations it also resulted in some challenges regarding teaching and social interaction. We noticed early on in the daily student feedback that students needed many breaks to be able to follow lectures in an online setting for an extended period of time. We ended up introducing 10 minutes breaks every 30-40 minutes to help students withstand the “zoom fatigue”.

We tried to offer a number of social activities around the core course activities. We noticed that participation in these activities was very low. This can probably be attributed to the fact that social activities were also purely online. Students were just exhausted after 6+ hours of online instruction every day and spending another 1-2 hours in front of a screen – even for social activities – was not very appealing to them. As for learning, since we think the social and networking aspects of the summer school are very important, we will probably integrate the social activities better into the course itself the next time we run it, at the expense of lectures and exercises.

We were conscious of potential issues with commitments to attend the summer school because we have had experience with low attendance in online teaching settings. As a countermeasure, we asked students to re-confirm their participation in the summer school after the initial round of invitations to attend the school at the end of the application process. We also kept a “waiting list” of students that did initially not make the cut to attend but had submitted high-quality applications. Six out of 40 students did not confirm their participation and we filled the spots with people from the waiting list.

As expected, offering the course as a free elective course in a purely online setting without any attendance fees created a lack of accountability for students to actually attend lectures. As a result, three students did not show up for any of the lectures without offering an excuse. Two students did not attend but excused themselves, citing unexpected child care obligations or sickness as reasons. Another two students did not attend and excused themselves, citing other work getting in the way of attending the summer school. The latter would probably not happen in an offline setting where people actually need to book trips and accommodation to attend the summer school, because this would create at least some level of commitment. In summary, 33 out of 40 students (83%) that signed up for the summer school ended up attending the majority of lectures and completing group projects.

Lastly, hands-on exercises and group projects involved a lot of programming. Providing students with programming help where needed was challenging in the online setting. Sharing screens and typing commands in a chat works to some extent, but it would be much easier to help students if lecturers could interact with them in an offline setting and help them on their laptops rather than through video chat.

**JSON**
Many APIs return JSON as a response format. To be able to easily work with the data, it first needs to be converted to a tabular format. While we taught students about how to handle pandas data frames in the Python crash course, we did not properly teach them how to handle data in JSON format and how to convert JSON to data frames. This created a number of problems and delays when students had to work on their projects and a lot of demand for programming support during the project week. A learning from this is to provide a dedicated tutorial on how to handle data in JSON format in the future, and/or to provide dedicated functions that convert JSON to well-formatted CSV files for a number of APIs.

**Group projects**
One surprising observation was the homogeneity of group projects by our participants. All of them used Twitter as the main source of data. All of them applied sentiment analysis as the main or secondary method for analyzing data. Almost all of the projects were related to politics. This was despite our efforts to show during the lecture week how broad the CSS field could be and despite the fact that many other APIs were introduced. However, the Twitter API was in the focus of some of our lectures and exercises and it seems that using it was the easiest option for our participants.

It could be that using the most familiar API was the only way to ensure that participants would be able to get some results given the time constraints of a project week. On the other hand, we feel that we didn’t pay enough attention to teaching participants how to choose a good research question and how to choose data sources/methods that would be the most appropriate to answer this question. Some participants mentioned that coming from a computational background they would like to learn more about social science, to learn how to choose a question, etc. Given the time constraints of a project week, we think the only solution would be to introduce a “proposal track” for projects in addition to a “practical track”. Creating a good research proposal would require work on selecting a good research question, exploring the relevant literature, thinking about the best data source and methods. However, properly done, these activities would easily consume the whole project week and that wouldn’t allow participants to try to get some data and perform preliminary analysis. We are not sure what would be the best compromise between providing a practical experience and devoting more time to general research competencies.

**Final remarks**
We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback after the school with participants emphasizing not only the quality of our content but also the special atmosphere of the school. We are not sure how to reproduce this because we don’t feel that we have done anything special and we are surprised by the positivity of feedback ourselves. However, we think that the fact that the school was run by two postdocs (not professors) might have contributed to that. This significantly reduced the distance between participants and lecturers and allowed us to openly talk about academic life, share our struggles, and critique the status quo. This openness seems to help to create a "we" feeling at the end of the school — as one participant put it in their feedback.

**Principle Organizer: Kat Albrecht**

### Introduction

SICSS Atlanta 2022 was held at Georgia State University in downtown Atlanta, specifically in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. This was a substantial undertaking since I had only arrived at GSU this academic year and did not have any connections on the campus or logistical knowledge of university policies. These barriers were overcome to have, what I consider, one of the best SICSS I’ve been part of to date (I had previously been organizing SICSS Chicago since 2018). We are also extremely proud to be, to our knowledge, one of the first partner sites to run in the Southern U.S. and were generally thrilled with the community support from our geo-co-located universities. We had participants and faculty speakers from a large number of area institutions and lots of interest in continuing SICSS ATL next year.

I organized the institute with the assistance of Cynthia Searcy, Georgia State’s Associate Dean for Academic Innovation. The Dean of the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Sally Wallace, generously essentially excused Cynthia from other duties during SICSS so she could help me. As will become a theme in this report, the support of GSU was absolutely critical to the success of the institute.

### Pre-arrival

The section to follow concerns organizational processes and pre-arrival materials.

**Funding**
SICSS ATL received $6,000 from the main site and over $10,000 from GSU. Money was spent in four key areas: TA stipend, meals, Prolific survey costs, and group project funding.

The budget request from the main site was originally closer to 12k, but I limited it severely at their request, and I do have some personal regrets about doing so. I did not take an honorarium for organizing the institute and did end up spending nearly 2 thousand dollars of my own money on flights/daily transportation to fully engage with the institute. In the past, the organizer honorarium defrayed these expenses. It was particularly difficult for me to do this as a first-year faculty member who was new to 9-month contracts. I did so because I was worried that we wouldn’t get funding for the institute at all but was a little disappointed to hear that honorarium were still given to some sites but not others. Next year, I will request honoraria because 2 of the co-organizers are PhD students, and I would not ask them to give their time without any compensation.

**Organization**
Cynthia and I met weekly from December through the summer institute, making sure all the logistical pieces were in place. Cynthia was enormously helpful during this process, since she had ready access to university listservs, knowledge of the campus and its vendors, and had more connections with area faculty than I did.

We largely followed the procedures I previously used to organize SICSS Chicago for a number of years to good effect. We created a Gmail account for SICSS ATL communications, with the intention of being able to hand it off to any Atlanta-area institution that may wish to rotate in teaching SICSS.

**Selection Process**
We opted for a high-effort application process to avoid attrition. We asked that participants give a research statement, a CV, a writing sample, and asked graduate students to provide contact information for a reference. We received 40 applications that we considered complete and plausible. We selected around 23 of these applications and with attrition had 20 participants complete the workshop (1 was no longer able to attend due to injury, 1 was not comfortable participating at the institute due to Covid-19, and 1had their partner test positive for Covid-19 during the institute and could not complete it). Participant recruitment focused on Atlanta area schools broadly construed, but participants came from Georgia State University, Georgia Tech, University of Massachusetts Boston, University of North Carolina Charlotte, the Georgia Policy Lab, University of Georgia, Yale University, University of Berkeley California, Mercer University, and Emory University. Participants were a healthy mix of professors, postdocs, and advanced graduate students.

**Pre-arrival**
We offered the usual suite of pre-arrival materials for the institute. There was evidence that many of the participants did read Bit-by-Bit as requested, but participants generally did not make use of TA office hours or use the coding tutorials extensively before the institute. Consistent with previous years, 1-3 participants contacted the teaching assistant, Olga Churkina, for help before the institute. However, participants did use the materials provided on the SICSS website during the institute, often mentioning reviewing them the night before a new topic or using them while working on their group projects.

### Week 1

We opened the institute with an outdoor reception at a local Atlanta eatery, where participants could optionally socialize before the first official day of the institute. Most participants attended this event, which seemed to be very positively received.

We held the institute in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, in a 12th floor room with a skyline view of Atlanta. The space was very well laid out for both collaboration and catering, with the advantage of making it clear that the institute was valued and prioritized by GSU. Similarly, our final presentations in Week 2 were held at the Curve, a focal feature of the GSU libraries.

We did not use any video content in SICSS Atlanta, instead opting to teach all of our content live. We felt this was a necessity for us in running an in-person institute to differentiate our content from something that could be accomplished virtually. I acted as the principal lecturer for the institute, giving most of the content lectures. While a lot of work, this effort did produce slide decks that can be used by next years’ organizers if they so choose. I focused on nailing the basics that participants would need to understand to fully engage with the research lectures brought by our guest speakers. We taught content across the institute in both R and Python due the stated preferences of our participants.

We had a healthy variety of local speakers with various expertise. Speakers at the institute included Charlotte Alexander (Georgia State University), Omar Isaac Asensio (Georgia Tech), Lauren Klein (Emory University), Jesse Lecy (Urban Institute and Arizona State University), and Dror Walter (Georgia State University). Speakers all gave research talks, and some (Alexander and Asensio) gave additional workshops on natural language processing and web scraping.

We ran the institute from Tuesday-Saturday due the Juneteenth Holiday and covered the SICSS core curriculum. This was a later-stage change, and we would prefer to not run the institute on a Saturday next year, since it was more difficult for local attendees to be available. We did the full iteration of each group exercise in the afternoons, with consistent success across groups. On occasion, some groups did not finish entirely, but we were fine with this, since it was still a strong learning experience. We deviated from the SICSS main curriculum in offering a different activity for digital surveys, just as we did at SICSS Chicago. In our version of the exercise, participants generate research questions, build the surveys, collect pilot data, and analyze that data to produce visualizations. All project groups were successful in completing this ambitious exercise.

### Week 2

We used a modified version of the design sprint activity to facilitate group formation for Week 2. I opted to run the sprint on Easy Retro, a free, no-registration platform where individuals invited to the board can upload cards with their ideas. I had participants form random groups and generate project ideas for 25ish minutes. They added a description of those ideas to the Easy Retro board. I then shuffled the groups and again had them ideate for 25ish minutes. Following this, there was a 10-minute period where any individual could add an idea to the Easy Retro board. Once both sets of group ideas and any additional individual ideas were posted, participants were given 6 votes to vote for projects they were interested in. The top voted projects were then assigned tables in the room where participants could meet and discuss them and develop them further. 5 project groups emerged out of a combination of this exercise and earlier group activities and discussions from the week.

To close the institute, groups presented for 20-25 minutes on their work so far. All groups gave excellent presentations, which were attended by a number of stakeholders (including the Dean and others) in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. The presentations are linked on the SICSS ATL schedule, along with other materials from the institute.

Week 2 also featured some optional social events, including a hike on the weekend and a closing happy hour at a nearby restaurant. Participants, especially non-local participants, responded positively to these events.

### Post-Institute

After the close of the institute, we conducted the SICSS ATL local grant competition. We received 4 applications from 4 groups of SICSS ATL participants. We opted to fund two of those proposals, one studying the rhetorical and social constructions around Juneteenth as a holiday, and the other a survey experiment about school gun violence. Both projects received money to run surveys related to their goals and promised money to defray publication fees. We applied several criteria to getting the money: a timeline in which it must be spent, that the project has IRB approval, that the project be pre-registered, and that the data be made public if it is ethical to do so. Projects that were not awarded received substantial feedback and encouragement to carry on, regardless.

A new feature we were happy to provide to participants this year was a SICSS 2022 LinkedIn badge that is easily updatable in the future, should any other sites/years want to use it.

### Looking Ahead to SICSS ATL 2023

I am already in progress with plans for SICSS ATL 2023. I am tentatively holding next year’s institute at Georgia Tech, with the help of the TA from SICSS ATL 2022, Olga Churkina, (who is dual enrolled at both GSU and Georgia Tech) and a Georgia Tech PhD student participant, Ryan Ellis, from SICSS ATL 2022. We are currently in the planning phase, building an advisory board of Georgia Tech faculty to assist in our organization efforts. I expect I will be rather involved in the daily runnings of the institute next year as well because it’s still early, but my long-term goal is to have Atlanta institutions trade off holding it with less involvement from me to maximize involvement across schools.

Our current planning priorities also include securing funding for the operations of SICSS Atlanta 2023. We have some positive interest from one Georgia Tech faculty member, Omar Isaac Asensio about sponsoring group projects in particular, which we are hopeful about. We expect that to be the most difficult financial resource to procure, as it is every year, because it is logistically complex.

<h2 class="display-4" id="bologna">SICSS-Bologna</h2>

**Application Process**

Participation was restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Nonetheless, there were no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. The idea was to invite about twelve participants.
Candidates were evaluated along different dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. To apply for the summer school, applicants had to submit the following documents: CV (max 2 pages), research statement (max 1 page, single-spaced), project proposal (max 2 pages, single-spaced), a writing sample (no more than 35 pages).

**Pre-Arrival and Boarding**

On May 10, we sent our decision letter to the admitted applicants. To confirm their participation, we asked them whether they could fully attend our event. A total of 14 participants were selected.
Due to the withdrawal of two students, we ended with a total of 12 candidates.
Once the admission procedure was over, we asked the participants to provide the organizers with a short biography and a picture to be included in the web site. During the weeks before the SICSS, we sent the participants several e-mails with detailed explanations regarding the schedule and the overall organization of the summer school.

**Developing the Program**

We planned a 2-weeks program, with a first week fully online, and a second week with activities organized in the classrooms provided by the Department of Political Sciences of the University of Bologna (UniBo). Both weeks have been organised with the help of 3 Teaching Assistants with specific technical skills in Statistical Methodology, Text Analysis and Informatics.
For development of the 2-weeks program, we wanted to balance two types of activities: lectures from selected experts and interactive learning through coding.
In the first online week we planned to engage guest experts to cover all the core topics in Computational Social Science. Lectures on the first week covered data collection, text analysis, digital surveys, digital experiments, and ethics of research. The second week was focused on guest researchers presenting larger CSS projects of in both private and academic environments.
Interactive laboratories have been tailored on the curricula of the admitted students. We took into consideration many possible activities, for example involving Network Analysis and Crowdsourcing (Mechanical Turk, etc.), but we noticed that for many students the primary interest was in Text Analysis. The laboratories have been delivered fully by the 3 TAs. We offered two online parallel tracks. In the Basic track, students have been introduced to coding Text Analysis in R with tidyverse, Twitter API, rvest, and tidytext. In the Advanced track we offered 2-hours classes on GitHub collaborations, advanced API (Wikipedia, Youtube) and inferential design. Most of the technical content provided has been coded in R.
In the week in Bologna, interactive laboratories have been planned to prompt discussion of methodology of research projects proposed by students. Teaching Assistants has been planned to stay at disposal of the students to provide first-aid support with coding.
For us, it was important that all the students had at least basic experience with R, so we pushed the students to self-train on R Studio with SICCS Online materials. We tested the admitted students on their training, and we found that the overall level of the class was sufficiently good to approach the packages in the Basic track. We also noticed that approximately all the students scored the same mark at the test, and that they failed only the most advanced questions of the test (for example, on R Markdown internal options). Since these advanced questions were not covered at SICCS Online materials, we have the strong feeling that students actually engaged themselves with pre-School training.
We set up a Slack channel within the SICCS environment, to pin all the updates and the relevant information for the students.
We also included social activities for the second week in Bologna, with one covered dinner and one covered aperitif. The University of Bologna provided spaces of socialization. We gifted one thermal bottle and one SICCS and UniBo t-shirt to each student at the end of the School.

**First Week**

The first week consisted fully of online activities. The week has been scheduled to provide to students the perception of a technical progression. Students were mostly coming from a background in Humanities, so we expected them to be more confident to humanities and data visualisation than statistical methodology.
On Monday, at 9 AM the Dean of the Department of Political Science of UniBo welcomed the students, and we run a general round of ice-breakers short presentations among the presents. The first lecture started on 10 AM, on the shift towards new CSS paradigm in the Ethics of Social Research. Laboratories in the afternoon touched two introductory topics. The Basic track covered pipeline programming in Tidyverse and ggplot. In particular, we showed to students functions as facet_wrap() for elegant multiple plots. The Advanced track guided the students to set up their Github account to R Studio and how to manage most of the functions of Git language for repository management. In this day, students spread equally to both Basic and Advanced tracks.
From Tuesday to Thursday, we kept a lighter schedule, with Lectures starting at 10 AM until 12 AM, and Laboratories starting at 2 PM. Lectures involved often watching videos together, often with a comment from the guest lecturer. In some cases, lecturers asked to students to participate in a online activity. The response from students to online activities was good.
Usually, laboratories lasted from 1 hour to 2 hours. Only the first hour of the laboratory was mandatory for the student, while the second hour was dedicated to specific applications of the covered techniques. In these days, most of the students backed from Advanced track to the Basic. The Advanced track provided different skills for advanced API and concluded the mini course with a discussion on causal inference. The Basic track showed to students how to scrape reviews from Amazon with rvest, and then use the scraped scores to validate lexicons for Sentiment Analysis. As an example of Topic Modeling, Latent Dirichlet Allocation has been performed on R.
Students actively participated in the laboratories, for example sharing their code on Zoom. Teaching assistants provided remote technical assistance to students at any hour of the day.
On Friday, no laboratory has been scheduled, but guest lecturer Chiara Binelli provided an extensive online activity on online experiments.

**Second Week**

The second week of SICSS was held in the traditional format for the pre-pandemic world - in-person. The Department of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Bologna hosted activities during the second week. On June 13, the first day of the offline week in Bologna, we held a welcome dinner.

The line-up of speakers included foreign and Italian practitioners and academics working in the field of computational social sciences. On June 13, Chris Albon, director of machine learning at the Wikimedia Foundation, spoke to the participants of the institute. On June 14, language technology educator Rachael Tatman presented the latest achievements in Natural language processing. The participants were interested in aspects of working outside of the academy with a background in social sciences, cooperation with technical specialists in the implementation of joint projects, incorporation of the theory about human behavior from social sciences in data-driven initiatives, etc.

Italian demographer Nicola Barban presented how digital data is used in contemporary demography. Annalisa Pelizza, in collaboration with Wouter Van Rossem, highlighted the importance of database structures operated by the EU states in profiling and framing migrants contacting with the European jurisdiction. Their lecture was accompanied by a short group exercise in network analysis.

During the second week, participants presented their own projects, after which they had time to work on them, receiving advice from teaching assistants on issues related to data processing, the use of appropriate statistical tools, and further improvement of research design.

**Debrief/Departure**

We realized that the formation of a schedule of hands-on sessions for two groups - basic and advanced, should not imply simultaneous classes. A number of topics covered in the advanced group were also relevant to the research projects of participants who chose to attend classes in the basic group. In the future, it would be better to draw up a schedule with consecutive classes.

The closing of SICSS Bologna was accompanied by a farewell aperitivo. We also made a gift in the form of a t-shirt and a bottle for all participants, speakers, and organizers.

<h2 class="display-4" id="covenant-university">SICSS-Covenant</h2>

SICSS-Covenant was hosted by the Centre for Economic Policy and Development Research (CEPDeR) at Covenant University, Nigeria, from 19 to 29 June 2022. The 10-day Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS) dubbed SICSS-Covenant 2022 was the first ever SICSS to be held in Nigeria and the ECOWAS Region. It was also one of three SICSS sites in Africa in 2022. This post-mortem on SICSS Covenant 2022 is divided into five main sections: 1) outreach and application process; 2) coding bootcamp 3) pre-arrival and onboarding; 4) the summer institute; 5) closing ceremony, departure and post-departure.

### Outreach and Application Process

We decided that our summer institute would focus primarily on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and we sought to explore how computational social science methods could contribute to better tracking of the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in African countries. We engaged two teaching assistants: one had prior experience with coordinating large academic events at Covenant University, while the other had a computer science background with significant coding experience. In choosing these two, we considered gender, their unique talents, and their potential to enrich the programme and effectively manage the diversities of the selected participants.

With regards to recruitment drive for participants, we solicited applications with several intentions. Chief among this was that we wanted a diverse yet cohesive group of participants in terms of skill sets and interests. We were also conscious that there were only two other sites in Africa and, as a result, were willing to consider and partially fund six applicants from other African countries.
We leveraged our networks as alumni of SICSS-Cape Town to reach out to colleagues to spread the word among students and early careers in their network. We also tried to reach potentially interested participants through emails to faculty that we thought might know interested participants. In addition, we targeted other top African universities (the University of Ghana and the University of Witwatersrand) and hosted a post-presentation information session with their students and early career researchers. Also, the CEPDeR fellows’ network across African countries and Covenant University platforms were utilised as the call for applications was showcased on their websites. Lastly, we placed advertisements in the newsletters/forums of the African Population Studies and AuthorAID, and announced the call for applications on our personal websites and other platforms like the [R-blogger](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/01/announcing-the-summer-institute-in-computational-social-science-covenant-university-nigeria/).

All applications were managed through a customised Google Form that sought information about participants’ evaluation of their own proficiency in R-programming and Python in addition to basic socio-demographic questions. We had a lengthy discussion about whether to accept letters of recommendation, particularly given earlier reports of their limited usefulness at previously held SICSS at other sites. Ultimately, we decided to request for recommendation letters primarily to filter the pool of applicants and focus on those who have carefully read the programme information and are likely to participate fully in the programme. We reviewed our pool of applications frequently and intensified our recruitment efforts targeting specific groups as the need arose.

We believe that the combination of our recruitment methods worked quite well because of the overwhelming number of applications we received despite this being our inaugural SICSS. We received 104 applications, mostly from Nigeria (75%) but also from other African countries, including Ghana (3), South Africa (3), Kenya (2), Zambia (2) and others. Our applicants were also very diverse in terms of research expertise, mostly from Economics (33), Sociology/Demography (32), but also from Computer Science (10), Geography (6) and others. The gender distribution of our applicants shows a higher proportion of male compared to female applicants (Fig. 1).

_Fig. 1: Gender Distribution of Applicants by Qualification_
<img src="https://ibb.co/cxzGw3d" alt="" width="600">

Three reviewers comprising one Covenant University faculty, a TA, and an organizer assessed each application independently. During the review process, we considered the diversity of research interests and whether there could be synergy in research collaborations. We also carefully reviewed the applicants’ motivation for participating in the programme and re-evaluated the role of recommendation letters. Although we discovered that the letters were not critical for our evaluation as they did not offer additional information than we obtained in other application materials, we hope to still request for letters of recommendation to limit the number of applications we have to screen in the future.

We then sorted applicants according to the average scores from the three reviewers. During the application review phase, we discovered many participants overestimated their proficiency in R/Python. In contrast, we realised that many of them only had some quantitative and statistical background but with very limited coding experience. We believe this issue cuts across Africa, especially because the computational social science (CSS) community in Africa is not as strong as in many other parts of the world. Based on our own evaluation of the applicants’ coding experience, we decided to follow a two-stage selection process in which applicants were first conditionally accepted and only given an unconditional offer once they had fully completed the coding bootcamp and demonstrated some proficiency in R-programming. This decision significantly reduced our pool of applicants to 29 conditionally accepted applicants who were enrolled in the coding bootcamp and 16 applicants who were offered an unconditional acceptance and ultimately attended the summer institute. Due to funding constraints and high regional flight costs, particularly from Malawi and Mozambique, three participants were invited but could not afford the flight cost to the summer institute even with partial funding.

### Coding Bootcamp

After conditionally selecting our participants, we decided that our primary programming language would be R, given the relatively few numbers of conditionally accepted applicants who were familiar with or interested in using Python. We did not emphasise one programming language over the other during our outreach activities but think that our team’s collective area of expertise may have influenced the pool of applications we received. In the future, we hope to partner with more colleagues in Computer Science to enhance the representation and mutual benefit of both programming languages, even more so now with the integration of R and Rstudio (now Posit).

_Fig. 2: Screenshot of DataCamp Leaderboard with our Participants' Progress_
<img src="https://ibb.co/60Y9JFK" alt="" width="600">

We received generous support from DataCamp to access over 360 interactive courses through DataCamp for the Classroom. This support lessened the burden of a virtual bootcamp on the organizing team while also providing a valuable opportunity to track our participants’ progress (see Fig. 2). We assigned a total of 19 courses covering a diverse range of topics (data wrangling, data analysis, data visualization and an introduction to programming) in R to the participants to complete over five weeks. Each course requires about four hours to complete, but the completion time could vary depending on the participant’s proficiency in coding. For most, this was manageable (particularly students), but for some, this was quite a lot to juggle amongst other work, family-related demands, and other competing activities at the time. We did not anticipate the burden these courses would have on our participants and the impacts on the attrition rate. In the future, we will allocate more weeks for the participants to complete the courses and conditionally accept more applicants.
The teaching assistants supported our conditionally accepted applicants. We also created a dedicated channel #sicss-covenant on Slack and asked the participants to reach us there if they required assistance with any aspect of the coding bootcamp. Participants did not access TA/computational help resources as often as we would have expected. We hypothesize that this may have occurred for a couple of reasons. First, the DataCamp virtual environment made learning fun, and there were hints for each exercise. Second, participants were hesitant about being the first to seek help in an open forum. In the future, we might ask participants to share the most challenging coding exercise that they managed to solve on their own and their winning solution on Slack. We think this may work well, given that participants are more willing to share their successes than failures. Also, knowing where they struggled and how they solved it may be helpful for other participants.
We tracked the participants’ progress every week. We sent targeted emails based on whether they were on track (likely to complete the week’s exercise), stalled (yet to start the week’s exercise) or not started (not completed their registration on DataCamp). We also think the DataCamp leader board may have fostered healthy competition among our participants.

### Pre-arrival and Onboarding

About three weeks to the start of the summer institute, we reviewed our applicants’ progress and unconditionally accepted those who have completed a significant number of courses. After the participants were unconditionally accepted, we begun to onboard them into the program. Our onboarding process included several steps, including gathering participant information and populating the people page. We shared a link to a Google form with the participants to fill out the “onboarding survey” to provide bio information for our website. We provided the participants with links to important sections of our website, including the schedule (with reading materials) and the people page (to know who is coming to SICSS-Covenant). We also included a link to the pre-arrival section of our location’s webpage and shared travel guidance to Covenant University and Nigeria (for international participants). We communicated with the participants primarily through email but also via the Slack channel. Due to the popularity of WhatsApp in our setting, our TAs also created and managed a WhatsApp group for emergency/informal updates.

### Summer Institute

In designing and developing the program, we relied on our collective experience as participants and a teaching assistant at SICSS-Cape Town, as well as our experience organising similar academic events. We set up goals that revolve around three blocks based on our applicants’ motivation: **training** of the next generation of computational social scientists who will be able to teach others and develop new tools; generate sound scholarly **research** evidence that leverages computational and digital tools to better understand the society and accelerate progress towards the SDG; build long-lasting academic/research **collaborations**.
To achieve these objectives, we structured our programme to be composed of five components: a research happy hour, invited presentations, tutorials, joint programmes with other sites, and group projects.

**Research Happy Hour**

Research happy hour emerged as one of the most exciting aspects of our programme as it was intended to prepare our participants for the invited presentations as well as tutorials. All participants were assigned four research articles to read, review and discuss. We asked groups to focus on the rationale of the study, the methodology and potential to replicate the results, limitations, and ethics, as well as how they could tailor the methods to their area of expertise.
During the research happy hour, the groups collate their ideas and share their key takeaways with everyone. To avoid having a few participants dominate group discussions, we asked each group to appoint a discussion leader and a rapporteur. No group member can take the same role twice at any time during the summer institute. Participants really enjoyed this aspect of the programme, and several reported that it prepared them for the main sessions of the day. Given the engagement and how the participants found it helpful, we would encourage other sites, particularly those with participants with limited CSS experience, to consider incorporating it into their programme.

**Invited Presentations**

During initial planning, we decided it was best to amend the lecture content into a live presentation to encourage participant engagement. We also focused on topics highly relevant to our site theme and collective research interests. We targeted researchers and academics who have an interest in Africa. Unfortunately, our preference for African-focused presentations and speakers limited our pool of potential speakers and made it challenging to find willing speakers. This challenge, however, reinforces the need for increased investment in CSS training and research in African countries.
Ultimately, we had nine fantastic speakers who shared their work on different aspects of CSS (including bibliometric analysis, sentiment/text analysis, machine learning, and new methods for survey research) with our participants. We were particularly fascinated by the level of detail in these presentations and their willingness to share their slides and code with our participants despite our inability to offer a reasonable honorarium due to funding constraints. Given the fact that most of our speakers were overseas, we were worried that an all-virtual speaker presentation would limit speaker-participant engagement and an opportunity to have a one-on-one session with the speakers. We allocated ample time (105 minutes) to each presentation so that there was enough time to interact with the speakers. In the future, we hope to attract more local speakers and additional funding to cover travel costs for speakers and offer a more reasonable honorarium in recognition of their efforts and time.

**Tutorials**

In addition to invited presentations, we incorporated tutorials into our programme, focusing on different aspects of programming and CSS (text analysis, machine learning, spatial analysis, r-package development, reproducible analysis). All the tutorials (except text analysis) were held live and supported by the TAs on-site. We note that the overall rating was very high for all the tutorials especially given that our tutorial leads were highly experienced and adapted their tutorials to suit our context (Nigeria).
There were some critical comments as well. Most importantly, our participants affirmed that condensing the programme into ten days rather than a full-two-week summer institute did not allow for a good balance between learning and practice. While virtual presentations also worked very well, the virtual environment for tutorials evidently did not work well for our group. A number of technical and infrastructural challenges (for example, slow PC processing speed and internet connection for installing packages) significantly affected some of our participants’ pace and ability to follow many of the tutorials. In the meantime, we have uploaded some of the tutorials on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq_kVsuQoMoW3nat49IyuYJUJGPB-WTcx) and made all teaching materials publicly available while in the future, we will extend the summer institute to two full weeks and focus on a single theme each day. Other programming tutorials (such as spatial analysis, R-package development, and reproducible analysis) will be held in the second week with group projects.

**Joint Programme with other Sites**

We collaborated with SICSS-Howard, SICSS-JIAS/IPATC, and SICSS-West Central Africa to organise a panel session focused on interrogating data collection strategies in Africa. We had a series of preparatory meetings, and when the event was finalised, we shared the information with our participants. Many of our participants enjoyed the session as it fostered a sense of shared experience. We hope to explore (with colleagues) opportunities for fostering cross-site interactions during this event so that our participants can interact with each other (our third goal - collaboration).
Although the mass collaboration/experiments session and the fragile families challenge are indeed exciting and could foster collaboration, we could not incorporate them into our programme because we wanted to tailor the programme specifically for the needs of our participants while also considering their technical skills. Instead, we liaised with an African-led data science company Zindi to provide our participants with a similar experience. Though Zindi was open and willing to sponsor a hackathon and provide our participants with their data science (or CSS) competition platform, we could not see the engagement through because of our extremely late engagement with the Zindi team. In the future, we hope to still liaise with Zindi and partner with other African sites.

**Group Projects**

A major part of SICSS is group research projects. Our experience from participating in previous SICSS has taught us that leaving the participants to develop CSS-focused research question, particularly among participants with limited CSS experience like ours, often leads to very ambitious projects. While it is important that participants also experience this research development phase, we decided that the most successful approach was to identify important research questions based on the topics covered during the summer institute. In line with this, we identified three important research questions that centre around different dimensions of the sustainable development goals (SDGs): good health and wellbeing (Goal 3), gender equality (Goal 5), and reduced inequalities (Goal 10).
In choosing our final projects, we were conscious of financial constraints and only shared projects that did not require funding or fieldwork with the team. Before their assignment to groups, we asked the participants to select two CSS methods they were likely to use in their work. We then assign participants to work on the pre-defined projects based on their interests and technical strength. This way, the participants hit the ground running and were able to complete significant work in the little time available. The participants worked well together, and it was particularly exciting to see how they applied their skills to new problems.

### Closing Ceremony, Departure and Post-Departure

**Closing Ceremony and Departure**

Our closing ceremony featured presentations of preliminary findings from all the group projects. The presentations and discussions were lively, and it was a great way to wrap up the week. The groups enjoyed sharing their ideas and discussing what worked and what could be done better. We distributed SWAG t-shirts to participants, and all participants were given a certificate of attendance. Ultimately, we were very happy with our cohort. It was particularly heart-warming for us to see the seriousness with which the participants engaged with all aspects of the programme, including the research happy hour, invited presentations, tutorials and group projects. We believe that our rigorous selection process may have contributed to our overall experience and helped us select participants who were likely to participate fully in the programme.

**Post-Departure**

We believe that our work has just begun at SICSS-Covenant. Over the coming months, we hope to support the groups to see their works through to dissemination and publication. We have also encouraged our participants to stay in touch with the SICSS community through our Slack channel, Facebook, WhatsApp group and participation in virtual group meetings.
<h2 class="display-4">Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2022 Post-mortem</h2>

**Published on:** Sep 14, 2022

We’ve just completed the 2022 [Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/). The purpose of the Summer Institutes is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institutes are for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). This summer we had a mixture of in-person institutes and virtual institutes across the world. In addition to [SICSS-Duke](#duke), which was organized by Chris Bail, there were 31 partner locations run by SICSS alumni.

The purpose of this document is to describe a) what we did, b) what we think worked well, and c) what we will do differently next time. We hope that this will be useful to other people organizing similar Summer Institutes. If you are interested in hosting a partner location of SICSS 2023 at your university, company, NGO, or governmental organization, please read our information for [potential partner locations](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/host).

This document includes post-mortem reports from all of our locations in order to facilitate comparisons. As you will see, different sites did things differently, and we think that this kind of customization was an important part of how we were successful.

<h2 class="display-4" id="amu-law">SICSS-AMU/Law</h2>

We’ve divided the post-mortem into 5 parts: 1) outreach and application process, 2) pre-arrival and onboarding, 3) the first week, 4) the second week (group projects) and 5) post-departure.

### 1. Outreach and application process

As the first SICSS in Poland, the SICSS-AMU/Law was quite challenging. That is because, we had to create the whole concept of the institute including a schedule, invitations, social media descriptions, graphics, and essential documentation. There were some tasks that we had to do together with double-checking, as the main description, which could be the base for further content. In the other tasks, like creating content on social media we were supported by students. However, even in advertising, there is always the kind of work that you cannot completely commit to students, as you are the most informed person about your project.

Our plan was to gather young scientists from Poland and surrounding countries through a broad advertising campaign and e-mail. Primarily, the traditional way of promotion through the University website, Facebook and some basic mailing didn't work. That is why we had to move the deadline to at least a month later. The result of brainstorming was that we had to run a paid advertisement and do some massive mailing. Going after the other locations, we tried to keep our Facebook fan page constantly up to date with regular news on speakers, schedules, interesting articles and the team. The information about the event was also disseminated on topical groups of scientific events, conferences and seminars. These traditional methods were supported with paid advertisement, targeted according to the criteria that we declared to consider in the application process. The whole content that we created on Facebook was also used on LinkedIn, however with little success.

As mentioned, we intensified also mailing as it is the only direct channel of communication with potential candidates. For that purpose, we created a database of e-mail addresses from selected countries based on publicly available sites. It turned out to be a huge volume of work, as we decided to copy individual addresses not only these of secretaries, institutes, chairs, and other offices. Probably we couldn't have done it without great support from students. In the effect, for three weeks we have sent around 15.000 e-mails with invitations to the Institute.

As a result, we received 50 applications ranging from China to the US and Europe. That was enough to run an institute and make some selections. In order to select participants we used the following criteria: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open-source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants, and 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we accounted for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities. An extremely important factor for us was the time zone. After some discussion, we decided to give a chance also to participants from Asia. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a mistake as after a few days they had to resign. A factor that was eventually hard to assess is digital skills. We encountered some applications that mentioned explicitly full possession of Windows/Microsoft Office and other software skills. This could have been an indicator that the applicant may acquire proficiency in other software quickly. However, this was not the case. Programming requires slightly different skills than those learned through extensive usage of office software.

What is important is to accept more people than planned. Primarily, we wanted to have 30 participants. Of the 35 accepted, only half confirmed participation. For that reason, we invited the next 10 people. Finally, on the first day of the institute, we had around 20 participants, with 15 that managed to finish. The other problem we had was the first deadline that we had to move at least a month because of an insufficient number of applications. It was, however, before massive mailing and paid Facebook campaign that we regard as the most efficient.

### 2. Pre-arrival and onboarding

To the selected group that confirmed their participation, various resources were indicated. First of all a book by Matt Salganik “Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age” was recommended. Second, SICSS regular boot camp (videos) was suggested. Third, we pointed out that special SICSS-AMU/Law Boot Camp would be available a week before the Institute.

Although the information was spread via e-mail and the Institute’s website, it seems that the resources did not enjoy much attention. In particular, the participants did not experience extensively the exclusive boot camp that took three evenings via Zoom. There could be various reasons for that, one of them being limited possession of coding skills, as the first (of three) boot camp workshops was considerably more frequented than the next ones. It is possible, some participants were discouraged with the amount of coding to face.

As the next days showed, the participants could have better familiarized themselves with SICSS videos that covered many of the issues that came when starting to write in R. It seems, that the practical aspect of the school was not obvious for some participants that were (positively) surprised with the number of exercise and programming tasks. This, however, does not mean they were well-prepared to deal with them with ease. Perhaps, a clearer message on that issue could have helped in better understanding of the Institute and skills needed.

We encountered no abundant correspondence regarding organizational matters. As it was pointed out, we received limited response from the candidates accepted to the Institute. Among those who confirmed, there were a few that either did not show up at all or quit after day 0 (virtual get-together) or day 1. We received no contact from them. In such cases it might be good to get in touch and learn about their motives (which can be either personal or due to the Institute’s agenda). We felt, however, that those people took seats from those who wanted to participate but were refused admission due to the maximum number of participants reached.

### 3. The first week

We began the first week with a virtual get-together on Sunday evening. We abandoned a traditional introductory round, during which every person says a few words about herself/himself. Instead, we launched a Kahoot quiz and asked for their motivation, background etc. In addition, we made two short (ca. 10-minute long) speed dating sessions in breakout rooms (3 persons in each room) with random allocation of participants.

We followed the traditional framework of the two-week SICSS, meaning that the first week was a mix of lectures and group activities. The day started between 12:00-13:00 and lasted until 17:30-18:30. This was supposed to allow the participants to catch up with their professional and personal responsibilities in the morning and/or read the handouts before the group exercises. In addition, this was supposed to mitigate the Zoom fatigue.

Typically, the guest lecture lasted 1,5 hours whilst group exercises took 2,5 hours. In addition, we allocated approximately one hour for brown-bag lunches in the Zoom breakout rooms, where participants were invited to discuss their ideas for the 2nd week's projects. The latter proved successful as we had two groups established already in the first week (the third group was established in the 2nd week). Brown-bag lunches arguably contributed to the positive group dynamic as most participants stayed online for the whole time and took the opportunity to get to know each other better. At the end of the day, we had a 30-minutes long wrap-up which was sufficient to summarize the exercises and remind about the reading assignments for tomorrow.

The main focus of our Institute was law, however, from the very beginning, we aimed to recruit participants with diverse background. This also meant that the topics, guest speakers, and exercises had to be law-related and at the same time accessible to non-lawyers. Therefore, we covered the following topics: 1) natural language processing, 2) prediction and classification, 3) online survey design, 4) experimental methods in law, and 5) plotting maps. Most participants decided to apply NLP methods in the second week, which suggests that this topic could be assigned at least one additional day. Most of the guest speakers shared their presentations and R code (posted on Slack) which were then extensively used by the participants. One of the lectures was programming-free and focused on the general issues related to computational social sciences (e.g., why a social scientist should learn programming) and turned out to be a great success for at least two reasons. Firstly, it arrived on Wednesday evening when the participants were exhausted with programming (and some of them contesting their ability to learn computational methods). Secondly, the meeting was run in an informal Q&A setting, which created a very comfortable environment.

Group exercises followed a structure where participants were split into smaller groups to work together on activities (which are all posted on our website and Slack). The exercises were programming-oriented and consisted of smaller tasks. Out of five tasks, participants were able to complete between 1 and 3, which induced us to implement the following changes starting from Day 3:

1. Introduce additional TAs during the group exercises.
2. Release the answers with annotated code gradually during the exercises.
3. Structure the exercises as follows: 30-minutes session in the breakout rooms and 15-mins plenary session, during which one of the programmers explained how to deal with a specific task.

The participants welcomed all these changes.

As most participants struggled with the basics of R programming, we have been thinking about some backup solutions. We decided to introduce two optional workshops on Orange Data Mining software which attracted ca. 70% of the participants. The software is based on Python, however, it provides an intuitive GUI. Most participants utilized Orange in the second week and performed at least an initial exploratory data analysis before moving to R.

### 4. The second week (group projects)

During the SICSS-AMU/Law, three groups were formed, each one realized one project. The participants mixed with each other in a very interesting way. The first group was mainly economic in nature and dealt with _IMF discourse change and continuity after covid19-pandemic._ The second group was of a mixed, legal-economic nature, and carried out the project _Transformation of EU's internal market._ The third group was purely legal and dealt with the project _Prediction of derogation of legal act basing on duration of vacatio legis._

From the substantive point of view, the topics of the projects were very interesting and well-thought-out. Basically, the research could be continued and probably could end up with successful publications, because the conclusions already presented during the SICSS were really promising.

From the programming point of view, all groups faced similar problems. Both, during the projects and during the workshops (in the first week). Participants were generally very inattentive and made a lot of typos. As a result, correctly written code did not work, which is very frustrating and, unfortunately, can be daunting. Another problem was misunderstanding the data structure and trying to write code without a plan. Unfortunately, this cannot be done. The programmer should have got a clear idea to write a program. Otherwise, the effects will be dissatisfactory. Such problems could be avoided if the participants took part in the general boot camp as well as in our extended one. Unfortunately, everyone openly admitted that they neglected this help. One solution could be to organize a mandatory boot camp for participants. After all, it is difficult to understand why the participants avoided using the materials provided to them (where the answers to most of their problems were found) and the R-documentation.

One of the strongest points of the projects was definitely the use of R at a satisfactory level by some groups. If the group did choose to use R, they did it quite well. The use of Orange can be indicated as a contrast. This is the tool that many participants have used, and this is the wrong way to go.

The groups hesitantly reached for the help of internet materials (Stack Overflow) or the extended boot camp provided by us. Definitely, this is good news, however, it was done rather inaccurately and superficially, which resulted in analyses of low quality. The ambition was also a big problem, the participants wanted more than they were able to do. However, considering that SICSS is an educational event, the confidence and ambition of the participants must be considered a success, even if projects suffered because of this.

It was clear that the closer to the deadline (Friday in the second week), the more intensified the work. Throughout the whole institute, TAs were available on duty hours every day, which did not meet with great interest. The exception was last Thursday, when there was a line of people willing to ask questions and get help. This is an area for improvement, perhaps it would be better to cancel duty hours, especially during the second week, and instead of this, make TAs supervisors of groups. One TA for one group.

The collaboration within the groups was particularly good. Members used two channels of communication. Most of the discussions took place via Slack chat. Sometimes, when needed, the participants organized video meetings at Zoom.

Using Slack as the main communication channel was a very good idea, even the free version was sufficient. The second channel of communication, more direct, was Zoom. To simplify usage and avoid problems, we organized every meeting and duty hour under the same link. Maybe one software for both chat and video meetings is a nice idea for improvement.

Participation in lectures from other locations was minor. The curriculum of SICSS-AMU/Law was very intense, so attending other lectures could be too hard. Nevertheless, such possibility requires more advertising.

### 5. Post-departure

The Institute was concluded in a friendly atmosphere with a noticeable vibe of success among those who made the biggest progress coding-wise. We encouraged the participants to continue using Slack as a platform to further develop their ideas, share information about grants or projects and network. We also suggested joining the SICSS world community to reach out to the broader group of scientists who apply computational methods in their work. We provided participants with personal certificates of completion of the Institute.

A good idea to monitor the execution of the Institute was to run short online surveys on Google Forms (anonymously). The participants were eager to answer them which helped make changes in week 1 as well as evaluate our work throughout the whole event.

According to the three surveys executed during the Institute, all presentations given by invited speakers enjoyed high or very high scores from participants. Despite the whole event being online, we noted that students “definitely made some connection with other participants” (70% of answers). A similar percentage declared that the schedule of the classes on a daily basis was well planned (67%) while some argued that they should start either earlier or later during the day. A very promising number of the participants (85%) responded that they loved working on a group project and even more of them (92%) declared that they are definitely going to further explore computational methods in their work. This surprisingly corresponds with answers we received after the first days of the Institute. When asked about the technical challenges of coding (including both very code writing as well as installation of various software and libraries) students' opinions were divided. Around 36% of participants declared they clearly expected such challenges. Nearly as many said they did not really expect that many technical difficulties, but expected some. There were single voices that having to deal with such computer challenges was a surprise. This all corresponds with an issue clearly brought in the interim survey, being little coding skills and not enough support from the institute regarding coding fundamentals, according to some of the participants. As it was suggested earlier, a clearer approach should have been taken by our organizing team, i.e. whether we take responsibility and teach the absolute basics or we assume that it is up to the participants to bring certain computer skills to the table.

We accepted with gratitude the feedback from participants who kept saying that there were two best things about the Institute: people (open-minded, enthusiastic and cooperative) and the possibility to grow (learning new research methods, and programming). We note that this was possible not only thanks to the support and funding from various institutions and thanks to highly-involved participants. We believe that this was achieved also by a committed group of organizers who looked out for each other and worked as one team, often beyond “working hours”.

### Programme design

To design the program, we relied on the experiences of our two main organizers (Jana Lasser and Ivan Smirnov), who had either already organized a SICSS location (Ivan, HSE, 2021) or participated in one (Jana, Helsinki, 2021). We designed the programme alongside our strengths and research interests as computational social scientists and invited external speakers to bring diversity and fill in gaps. This included lectures offering a critical perspective on the state of the field of CSS, publishing CSS research and common pitfalls in CSS research projects as well as hands-on lectures on how to use APIs to collect data, how to run large-scale surveys on Amazon Mechanical turk and how to leverage large language models for CSS research. These lectures were complemented by two lectures by our senior organizers: an introduction to networks for CSS research from Markus Strohmaier and a lecture on how to combine large-scale surveys with digital trace data by David Garcia. We were also fortunate to welcome Suhem Parack to give us an introduction to using the Twitter API v2 to collect data for CSS research. Since both main organizers mainly work with Python, we decided to commit to teaching our SICSS location completely in Python, aiming to contribute teaching materials in Python to the collection of teaching materials of SICSS.

Since both main organizers mainly work with Python, we decided to commit to teaching our SICSS location completely in Python, aiming to contribute teaching materials in Python to the collection of teaching materials of SICSS.

**Venue**
Our SICSS location was funded by a funding programme of TU Graz, dedicated to fund online teaching activities that are collaboratively hosted by two universities - in our case RWTH Aachen and TU Graz. We, therefore, planned our programme to take place completely online. We designed the outline of our programme similar to other SICSS locations, planning for one week of lectures and hands-on exercises, followed by one week of group project work with talks by guest lecturers in the evenings to have a common event every day.

### Before the summer school

**Outreach**
We specifically advertised our SICSS location within our two host universities TU Graz and RWTH Aachen, since we wanted to attract students from the Computational Social Systems master’s programme at both universities. We, therefore, advertised the summer school in short pitches in relevant lectures during the winter semester and through mailing lists of lecturers and students of the master’s programme. In addition, we advertised our location over social media channels (Twitter and LinkedIn) as well as over the main SICSS website.

**Applications**
We attracted a total of 71 applications. Students had to submit an academic CV and a motivation letter (1 page), describing their motivation to participate in our SICSS location and the potential benefit for their study and research career. We required no prior programming skills and no specific disciplinary background to apply. Students needed to have at least a bachelor’s degree to apply to our location. We also decided not to ask for recommendation letters. We believe that recommendation letters impose a disproportionate burden on students while there is little evidence of their usefulness.

We aimed to admit 40 students, with guaranteed spots for students from TU and KFU Graz and RWTH Aachen in case they meet the minimum requirements and submit a complete application. We received a total of 5 applications from TU Graz and 3 from RWTH Aachen. The rest of the applications came from students enrolled at other universities. We also received a number of applications from PostDocs or people that had left academia. Given the choice of admitting a student or a non-student with similarly strong application materials, we decided to admit the student, since we felt they would benefit more from our summer school. We also paid special attention to applicants from groups that are underrepresented in CSS.

We invited a total of 40 students to participate in our SICSS location. The disciplinary backgrounds of the people admitted to our location were very diverse, including students from political science (7), computer science (6), social science (5), psychology (5), computational social science (4), economics (3), collective intelligence (2) and physics, statistics, linguistics, data science, geography, engineering, journalism, and genders studies (1 student each). Similarly, the country of residence of our students was very diverse, with the rather high prevalence of German (8) and Austrian (5) students reflecting our increased outreach efforts in these countries, followed by the US (5), Morocco (3), UK (2), Russia (2) and Italy, South Africa, China, Portugal, Denmark, Switzerland, Argentina, Turkey, Korea, Belgium, France, Serbia, Greece and Iran (1 student each). Gender identities were almost balanced, with 22 participants identifying as male, 17 as female, and 1 as non-binary. Rejection rates were similarly balanced, with 52% of the rejected participants identifying as male, 45% as female, and 3% as neither.

**Python crash course**
We did not require any previous (Python) programming knowledge to enroll in our summer school. To get everybody up-to-speed regarding programming in Python, we offered a voluntary two-week Python crash course in the month before our summer school. The course consisted of a curated collection of online learning materials, tailored to fit the needs of participants in our summer school with introductions to general programming in Python (first week) and introductions to the libraries pandas, networkx, statsmodels and matplotlib in the second week. The Python crash course was supervised by two of our teaching assistants, Moritz Erlacher and Florian Hofer, who contributed a great deal of experience in teaching beginner-level programming courses in Python. Since we were aware that our participants had other study or work commitments in the month leading up to the summer school, we designed the Python crash course to be mainly self-paced learning with videos and exercises in Jupyter Notebooks. We offered office hours in the early mornings and late afternoons to help with questions regarding the exercises. The crash course was greatly appreciated by our participants and helped to equilibrate the level of programming skills across our participants at least a bit.

**Onboarding**
In addition to the Python crash course, we pointed students to the online learning materials provided by SICSS and asked them to apply for academic access to the Twitter API. We provided a guide on how to apply for academic access within the scope of our summer school, which was greatly appreciated by students. A total of 33 students applied for academic access and 6 of these applications were denied for unknown reasons.

### During the summer school

**Instruction week**
During the instruction week, we usually started with one lecture of 60-90 minutes at 9:30, followed by one hands-on exercise or group discussion for 90-120 minutes. We made sure to provide breaks of 10 minutes every 45-60 minutes since student feedback indicated that in the online setting it was often not easy to follow instructions for extended blocks of time. After a lunch break of 60 minutes, we had another lecture of 60-90 minutes, followed by a hands-on exercise of 90 minutes and a group discussion of 15-20 minutes to wrap up the day. We asked students for feedback every day, asking them “what did you like about today’s sessions” and “what could be improved”? We received very helpful comments and ideas on how to improve online collaboration from the students, which we tried to implement on the following day. Students indicated that they greatly appreciated that their feedback was promptly incorporated into our location’s organization. We also received a lot of very positive feedback, which was very uplifting to read when preparing the sessions for the next day.

On Friday afternoon we hosted a brainstorming session of 2x60 minutes in random groups of four students each to generate project ideas. Students had to provide an idea title, short description, and responsible person for follow-up questions. This generated a total of 34 ideas. Students could then indicate their interest in working on one of these projects, with the aim of forming project groups of 3-4 students each for the project work in the following week.

**Project week**
We matched people into groups over the weekend between the instruction and project week and students could start working on their projects on Monday morning. We asked them to self-organize their working schedule during the project week, indicating that we expected approximately 5 hours of project work every day. The matching resulted in a total of 10 project groups. We split the supervision of the project groups between the two main lecturers such that each lecturer was responsible for supervising 5 groups. We asked groups to have daily check-ins of ~20 minutes every day. During these check-ins we met the groups in a video chat and helped them with a clearer definition of their research objectives and methods as well as methodological issues. In addition to the daily supervision check-ins, we provided programming support by teaching assistants, who offered office hours in the mornings and afternoons to help with programming questions. Projects were presented on the last day of the summer school. Every group had 10 minutes to present what they worked on plus five minutes of questions.

**Guest speakers**
We invited a total of 8 guest speakers to host lectures, talks, and tutorials during our summer school.

- Anna Di Natale hosted a [hands-on tutorial](https://github.com/JanaLasser/SICSS-aachen-graz/blob/main/02_02_MTurk/SICCSS_MTurk_slides.pdf) on how to use Amazon Mechanical Turk to design and run surveys on day 2.
- Max Pellert hosted a [hands-on tutorial](https://github.com/JanaLasser/SICSS-aachen-graz/blob/main/01_02_digital_trace_data/exercise/gdp_foi_tutorial.ipynb) on how to use digital trace data to answer CSS questions on day 1 and another tutorial on how to leverage large language models for sentiment and emotion classification on day 3.
- David Garcia gave a [lecture](https://dgarcia-eu.github.io/SICSS-2022/#1) on “Combining surveys and big data” on day 3.
- Markus Strohmaier gave a [lecture](https://github.com/JanaLasser/SICSS-aachen-graz/blob/main/03_02_networks/introduction_to_networks_in_CSS.pdf) on “Introduction to networks in CSS” on day 3.
- Suhem Parack gave a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZMNM-dyvk&feature=youtu.be) on how to use the Twitter v2 API.
- Chris Bail gave a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1MDoVXkIBQ&feature=youtu.be) on “New Platforms for Studying Social Media & Polarization”
- Roberta Sinatra gave a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_ZW_pvZY08&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=JanaLasser) on “Quantifying the dynamics of impact in science and art”
- Alina Arseniev-Koehler gave a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00OJj0Ny2XQ&ab_channel=JanaLasser) on “Integrating Topic Modeling and Word Embedding to Characterize Violent Deaths”

When inviting our guest speakers, we tried to showcase cool research by young scholars in our field, as well as provide lectures on foundational aspects of CSS research by established researchers that complemented our lectures. We made sure that each guest lecturer had ample time for Q&A with the students and enjoyed lively discussions after the talks.

**Social activities**

Next to the lectures, exercises, and project work, our student assistant Alina Kopkow organized voluntary social activities to give students the opportunity to get to know each other and the lectures in a non-work context.

On the Sunday evening before the summer school started we organized an informal meet-and-greet with crowd-sourced questions. This event was appreciated by our students and about half of the registered participants showed up.

On the second day of the summer school we organized an online pub-quiz where students could win a copy of either “Bit by Bit” or “Everybody lies”. We had three student teams with three to four students each competing for the prize. The activity was a lot of fun but we felt that more online activities after a long day of online lectures and exercises are not optimal.

At the end of the first week, we organized a hybrid treasure hunt in Graz and Aachen with “agents” on the ground walking through the two cities to find clues and online teams to solve riddles. Only two participants showed up for our treasure hunt and we, therefore, scrapped the group in Graz and only ran the one in Aachen. While the concept of the treasure hunt worked and is a good way to show online students around the city it was definitely too much after a full week of online lectures.

In addition to these activities, we organized a Twitter list for all participants and lecturers of SICSS Aachen Graz to follow each other and network after the summer school. This was greatly appreciated and almost all of our participants are part of this list.

### Logistics

**Finances**
We received a grant of 15,000€ from TU Graz to organize a “joint online course”. We used this money to hire four student assistants to help with the python programming crash course, python programming support during the summer school, and the organization of social activities. In addition, we paid honoraria of 500€ per lecture to our external speakers from these funds. Since our location was run completely online, we did not need funds for student accommodation or food. Initially, we wanted to compensate our two main organizers for their efforts as well, but this was not possible with these funds.

**Communication**
Our main communication channel during the summer school was the SICSS Slack platform. There, we created one main channel for our location, and two additional channels, one for programming support and one to collect links to useful information. In addition, we sent all important information and reminders for lectures by invited speakers over email.

### Logistics

**Social aspects of online learning & interaction**
Our course was organized completely online to accommodate students from different locations. While this was very useful to attract many students from different locations it also resulted in some challenges regarding teaching and social interaction. We noticed early on in the daily student feedback that students needed many breaks to be able to follow lectures in an online setting for an extended period of time. We ended up introducing 10 minutes breaks every 30-40 minutes to help students withstand the “zoom fatigue”.

We tried to offer a number of social activities around the core course activities. We noticed that participation in these activities was very low. This can probably be attributed to the fact that social activities were also purely online. Students were just exhausted after 6+ hours of online instruction every day and spending another 1-2 hours in front of a screen – even for social activities – was not very appealing to them. As for learning, since we think the social and networking aspects of the summer school are very important, we will probably integrate the social activities better into the course itself the next time we run it, at the expense of lectures and exercises.

We were conscious of potential issues with commitments to attend the summer school because we have had experience with low attendance in online teaching settings. As a countermeasure, we asked students to re-confirm their participation in the summer school after the initial round of invitations to attend the school at the end of the application process. We also kept a “waiting list” of students that did initially not make the cut to attend but had submitted high-quality applications. Six out of 40 students did not confirm their participation and we filled the spots with people from the waiting list.

As expected, offering the course as a free elective course in a purely online setting without any attendance fees created a lack of accountability for students to actually attend lectures. As a result, three students did not show up for any of the lectures without offering an excuse. Two students did not attend but excused themselves, citing unexpected child care obligations or sickness as reasons. Another two students did not attend and excused themselves, citing other work getting in the way of attending the summer school. The latter would probably not happen in an offline setting where people actually need to book trips and accommodation to attend the summer school, because this would create at least some level of commitment. In summary, 33 out of 40 students (83%) that signed up for the summer school ended up attending the majority of lectures and completing group projects.

Lastly, hands-on exercises and group projects involved a lot of programming. Providing students with programming help where needed was challenging in the online setting. Sharing screens and typing commands in a chat works to some extent, but it would be much easier to help students if lecturers could interact with them in an offline setting and help them on their laptops rather than through video chat.

**JSON**
Many APIs return JSON as a response format. To be able to easily work with the data, it first needs to be converted to a tabular format. While we taught students about how to handle pandas data frames in the Python crash course, we did not properly teach them how to handle data in JSON format and how to convert JSON to data frames. This created a number of problems and delays when students had to work on their projects and a lot of demand for programming support during the project week. A learning from this is to provide a dedicated tutorial on how to handle data in JSON format in the future, and/or to provide dedicated functions that convert JSON to well-formatted CSV files for a number of APIs.

**Group projects**
One surprising observation was the homogeneity of group projects by our participants. All of them used Twitter as the main source of data. All of them applied sentiment analysis as the main or secondary method for analyzing data. Almost all of the projects were related to politics. This was despite our efforts to show during the lecture week how broad the CSS field could be and despite the fact that many other APIs were introduced. However, the Twitter API was in the focus of some of our lectures and exercises and it seems that using it was the easiest option for our participants.

It could be that using the most familiar API was the only way to ensure that participants would be able to get some results given the time constraints of a project week. On the other hand, we feel that we didn’t pay enough attention to teaching participants how to choose a good research question and how to choose data sources/methods that would be the most appropriate to answer this question. Some participants mentioned that coming from a computational background they would like to learn more about social science, to learn how to choose a question, etc. Given the time constraints of a project week, we think the only solution would be to introduce a “proposal track” for projects in addition to a “practical track”. Creating a good research proposal would require work on selecting a good research question, exploring the relevant literature, thinking about the best data source and methods. However, properly done, these activities would easily consume the whole project week and that wouldn’t allow participants to try to get some data and perform preliminary analysis. We are not sure what would be the best compromise between providing a practical experience and devoting more time to general research competencies.

**Final remarks**
We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback after the school with participants emphasizing not only the quality of our content but also the special atmosphere of the school. We are not sure how to reproduce this because we don’t feel that we have done anything special and we are surprised by the positivity of feedback ourselves. However, we think that the fact that the school was run by two postdocs (not professors) might have contributed to that. This significantly reduced the distance between participants and lecturers and allowed us to openly talk about academic life, share our struggles, and critique the status quo. This openness seems to help to create a "we" feeling at the end of the school — as one participant put it in their feedback.

<h2 class="display-4" id="atlanta">SICSS-Atlanta</h2>

**Principle Organizer: Kat Albrecht**

### Introduction

SICSS Atlanta 2022 was held at Georgia State University in downtown Atlanta, specifically in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. This was a substantial undertaking since I had only arrived at GSU this academic year and did not have any connections on the campus or logistical knowledge of university policies. These barriers were overcome to have, what I consider, one of the best SICSS I’ve been part of to date (I had previously been organizing SICSS Chicago since 2018). We are also extremely proud to be, to our knowledge, one of the first partner sites to run in the Southern U.S. and were generally thrilled with the community support from our geo-co-located universities. We had participants and faculty speakers from a large number of area institutions and lots of interest in continuing SICSS ATL next year.

I organized the institute with the assistance of Cynthia Searcy, Georgia State’s Associate Dean for Academic Innovation. The Dean of the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Sally Wallace, generously essentially excused Cynthia from other duties during SICSS so she could help me. As will become a theme in this report, the support of GSU was absolutely critical to the success of the institute.

### Pre-arrival

The section to follow concerns organizational processes and pre-arrival materials.

**Funding**
SICSS ATL received $6,000 from the main site and over $10,000 from GSU. Money was spent in four key areas: TA stipend, meals, Prolific survey costs, and group project funding.

The budget request from the main site was originally closer to 12k, but I limited it severely at their request, and I do have some personal regrets about doing so. I did not take an honorarium for organizing the institute and did end up spending nearly 2 thousand dollars of my own money on flights/daily transportation to fully engage with the institute. In the past, the organizer honorarium defrayed these expenses. It was particularly difficult for me to do this as a first-year faculty member who was new to 9-month contracts. I did so because I was worried that we wouldn’t get funding for the institute at all but was a little disappointed to hear that honorarium were still given to some sites but not others. Next year, I will request honoraria because 2 of the co-organizers are PhD students, and I would not ask them to give their time without any compensation.

**Organization**
Cynthia and I met weekly from December through the summer institute, making sure all the logistical pieces were in place. Cynthia was enormously helpful during this process, since she had ready access to university listservs, knowledge of the campus and its vendors, and had more connections with area faculty than I did.

We largely followed the procedures I previously used to organize SICSS Chicago for a number of years to good effect. We created a Gmail account for SICSS ATL communications, with the intention of being able to hand it off to any Atlanta-area institution that may wish to rotate in teaching SICSS.

**Selection Process**
We opted for a high-effort application process to avoid attrition. We asked that participants give a research statement, a CV, a writing sample, and asked graduate students to provide contact information for a reference. We received 40 applications that we considered complete and plausible. We selected around 23 of these applications and with attrition had 20 participants complete the workshop (1 was no longer able to attend due to injury, 1 was not comfortable participating at the institute due to Covid-19, and 1had their partner test positive for Covid-19 during the institute and could not complete it). Participant recruitment focused on Atlanta area schools broadly construed, but participants came from Georgia State University, Georgia Tech, University of Massachusetts Boston, University of North Carolina Charlotte, the Georgia Policy Lab, University of Georgia, Yale University, University of Berkeley California, Mercer University, and Emory University. Participants were a healthy mix of professors, postdocs, and advanced graduate students.

**Pre-arrival**
We offered the usual suite of pre-arrival materials for the institute. There was evidence that many of the participants did read Bit-by-Bit as requested, but participants generally did not make use of TA office hours or use the coding tutorials extensively before the institute. Consistent with previous years, 1-3 participants contacted the teaching assistant, Olga Churkina, for help before the institute. However, participants did use the materials provided on the SICSS website during the institute, often mentioning reviewing them the night before a new topic or using them while working on their group projects.

### Week 1

We opened the institute with an outdoor reception at a local Atlanta eatery, where participants could optionally socialize before the first official day of the institute. Most participants attended this event, which seemed to be very positively received.

We held the institute in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, in a 12th floor room with a skyline view of Atlanta. The space was very well laid out for both collaboration and catering, with the advantage of making it clear that the institute was valued and prioritized by GSU. Similarly, our final presentations in Week 2 were held at the Curve, a focal feature of the GSU libraries.

We did not use any video content in SICSS Atlanta, instead opting to teach all of our content live. We felt this was a necessity for us in running an in-person institute to differentiate our content from something that could be accomplished virtually. I acted as the principal lecturer for the institute, giving most of the content lectures. While a lot of work, this effort did produce slide decks that can be used by next years’ organizers if they so choose. I focused on nailing the basics that participants would need to understand to fully engage with the research lectures brought by our guest speakers. We taught content across the institute in both R and Python due the stated preferences of our participants.

We had a healthy variety of local speakers with various expertise. Speakers at the institute included Charlotte Alexander (Georgia State University), Omar Isaac Asensio (Georgia Tech), Lauren Klein (Emory University), Jesse Lecy (Urban Institute and Arizona State University), and Dror Walter (Georgia State University). Speakers all gave research talks, and some (Alexander and Asensio) gave additional workshops on natural language processing and web scraping.

We ran the institute from Tuesday-Saturday due the Juneteenth Holiday and covered the SICSS core curriculum. This was a later-stage change, and we would prefer to not run the institute on a Saturday next year, since it was more difficult for local attendees to be available. We did the full iteration of each group exercise in the afternoons, with consistent success across groups. On occasion, some groups did not finish entirely, but we were fine with this, since it was still a strong learning experience. We deviated from the SICSS main curriculum in offering a different activity for digital surveys, just as we did at SICSS Chicago. In our version of the exercise, participants generate research questions, build the surveys, collect pilot data, and analyze that data to produce visualizations. All project groups were successful in completing this ambitious exercise.

### Week 2

We used a modified version of the design sprint activity to facilitate group formation for Week 2. I opted to run the sprint on Easy Retro, a free, no-registration platform where individuals invited to the board can upload cards with their ideas. I had participants form random groups and generate project ideas for 25ish minutes. They added a description of those ideas to the Easy Retro board. I then shuffled the groups and again had them ideate for 25ish minutes. Following this, there was a 10-minute period where any individual could add an idea to the Easy Retro board. Once both sets of group ideas and any additional individual ideas were posted, participants were given 6 votes to vote for projects they were interested in. The top voted projects were then assigned tables in the room where participants could meet and discuss them and develop them further. 5 project groups emerged out of a combination of this exercise and earlier group activities and discussions from the week.

To close the institute, groups presented for 20-25 minutes on their work so far. All groups gave excellent presentations, which were attended by a number of stakeholders (including the Dean and others) in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. The presentations are linked on the SICSS ATL schedule, along with other materials from the institute.

Week 2 also featured some optional social events, including a hike on the weekend and a closing happy hour at a nearby restaurant. Participants, especially non-local participants, responded positively to these events.

### Post-Institute

After the close of the institute, we conducted the SICSS ATL local grant competition. We received 4 applications from 4 groups of SICSS ATL participants. We opted to fund two of those proposals, one studying the rhetorical and social constructions around Juneteenth as a holiday, and the other a survey experiment about school gun violence. Both projects received money to run surveys related to their goals and promised money to defray publication fees. We applied several criteria to getting the money: a timeline in which it must be spent, that the project has IRB approval, that the project be pre-registered, and that the data be made public if it is ethical to do so. Projects that were not awarded received substantial feedback and encouragement to carry on, regardless.

A new feature we were happy to provide to participants this year was a SICSS 2022 LinkedIn badge that is easily updatable in the future, should any other sites/years want to use it.

### Looking Ahead to SICSS ATL 2023

I am already in progress with plans for SICSS ATL 2023. I am tentatively holding next year’s institute at Georgia Tech, with the help of the TA from SICSS ATL 2022, Olga Churkina, (who is dual enrolled at both GSU and Georgia Tech) and a Georgia Tech PhD student participant, Ryan Ellis, from SICSS ATL 2022. We are currently in the planning phase, building an advisory board of Georgia Tech faculty to assist in our organization efforts. I expect I will be rather involved in the daily runnings of the institute next year as well because it’s still early, but my long-term goal is to have Atlanta institutions trade off holding it with less involvement from me to maximize involvement across schools.

Our current planning priorities also include securing funding for the operations of SICSS Atlanta 2023. We have some positive interest from one Georgia Tech faculty member, Omar Isaac Asensio about sponsoring group projects in particular, which we are hopeful about. We expect that to be the most difficult financial resource to procure, as it is every year, because it is logistically complex.

<h2 class="display-4" id="bologna">SICSS-Bologna</h2>

**Application Process**

Participation was restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Nonetheless, there were no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. The idea was to invite about twelve participants.
Candidates were evaluated along different dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. To apply for the summer school, applicants had to submit the following documents: CV (max 2 pages), research statement (max 1 page, single-spaced), project proposal (max 2 pages, single-spaced), a writing sample (no more than 35 pages).

**Pre-Arrival and Boarding**

On May 10, we sent our decision letter to the admitted applicants. To confirm their participation, we asked them whether they could fully attend our event. A total of 14 participants were selected.
Due to the withdrawal of two students, we ended with a total of 12 candidates.
Once the admission procedure was over, we asked the participants to provide the organizers with a short biography and a picture to be included in the web site. During the weeks before the SICSS, we sent the participants several e-mails with detailed explanations regarding the schedule and the overall organization of the summer school.

**Developing the Program**

We planned a 2-weeks program, with a first week fully online, and a second week with activities organized in the classrooms provided by the Department of Political Sciences of the University of Bologna (UniBo). Both weeks have been organised with the help of 3 Teaching Assistants with specific technical skills in Statistical Methodology, Text Analysis and Informatics.
For development of the 2-weeks program, we wanted to balance two types of activities: lectures from selected experts and interactive learning through coding.
In the first online week we planned to engage guest experts to cover all the core topics in Computational Social Science. Lectures on the first week covered data collection, text analysis, digital surveys, digital experiments, and ethics of research. The second week was focused on guest researchers presenting larger CSS projects of in both private and academic environments.
Interactive laboratories have been tailored on the curricula of the admitted students. We took into consideration many possible activities, for example involving Network Analysis and Crowdsourcing (Mechanical Turk, etc.), but we noticed that for many students the primary interest was in Text Analysis. The laboratories have been delivered fully by the 3 TAs. We offered two online parallel tracks. In the Basic track, students have been introduced to coding Text Analysis in R with tidyverse, Twitter API, rvest, and tidytext. In the Advanced track we offered 2-hours classes on GitHub collaborations, advanced API (Wikipedia, Youtube) and inferential design. Most of the technical content provided has been coded in R.
In the week in Bologna, interactive laboratories have been planned to prompt discussion of methodology of research projects proposed by students. Teaching Assistants has been planned to stay at disposal of the students to provide first-aid support with coding.
For us, it was important that all the students had at least basic experience with R, so we pushed the students to self-train on R Studio with SICCS Online materials. We tested the admitted students on their training, and we found that the overall level of the class was sufficiently good to approach the packages in the Basic track. We also noticed that approximately all the students scored the same mark at the test, and that they failed only the most advanced questions of the test (for example, on R Markdown internal options). Since these advanced questions were not covered at SICCS Online materials, we have the strong feeling that students actually engaged themselves with pre-School training.
We set up a Slack channel within the SICCS environment, to pin all the updates and the relevant information for the students.
We also included social activities for the second week in Bologna, with one covered dinner and one covered aperitif. The University of Bologna provided spaces of socialization. We gifted one thermal bottle and one SICCS and UniBo t-shirt to each student at the end of the School.

**First Week**

The first week consisted fully of online activities. The week has been scheduled to provide to students the perception of a technical progression. Students were mostly coming from a background in Humanities, so we expected them to be more confident to humanities and data visualisation than statistical methodology.
On Monday, at 9 AM the Dean of the Department of Political Science of UniBo welcomed the students, and we run a general round of ice-breakers short presentations among the presents. The first lecture started on 10 AM, on the shift towards new CSS paradigm in the Ethics of Social Research. Laboratories in the afternoon touched two introductory topics. The Basic track covered pipeline programming in Tidyverse and ggplot. In particular, we showed to students functions as facet_wrap() for elegant multiple plots. The Advanced track guided the students to set up their Github account to R Studio and how to manage most of the functions of Git language for repository management. In this day, students spread equally to both Basic and Advanced tracks.
From Tuesday to Thursday, we kept a lighter schedule, with Lectures starting at 10 AM until 12 AM, and Laboratories starting at 2 PM. Lectures involved often watching videos together, often with a comment from the guest lecturer. In some cases, lecturers asked to students to participate in a online activity. The response from students to online activities was good.
Usually, laboratories lasted from 1 hour to 2 hours. Only the first hour of the laboratory was mandatory for the student, while the second hour was dedicated to specific applications of the covered techniques. In these days, most of the students backed from Advanced track to the Basic. The Advanced track provided different skills for advanced API and concluded the mini course with a discussion on causal inference. The Basic track showed to students how to scrape reviews from Amazon with rvest, and then use the scraped scores to validate lexicons for Sentiment Analysis. As an example of Topic Modeling, Latent Dirichlet Allocation has been performed on R.
Students actively participated in the laboratories, for example sharing their code on Zoom. Teaching assistants provided remote technical assistance to students at any hour of the day.
On Friday, no laboratory has been scheduled, but guest lecturer Chiara Binelli provided an extensive online activity on online experiments.

**Second Week**

The second week of SICSS was held in the traditional format for the pre-pandemic world - in-person. The Department of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Bologna hosted activities during the second week. On June 13, the first day of the offline week in Bologna, we held a welcome dinner.

The line-up of speakers included foreign and Italian practitioners and academics working in the field of computational social sciences. On June 13, Chris Albon, director of machine learning at the Wikimedia Foundation, spoke to the participants of the institute. On June 14, language technology educator Rachael Tatman presented the latest achievements in Natural language processing. The participants were interested in aspects of working outside of the academy with a background in social sciences, cooperation with technical specialists in the implementation of joint projects, incorporation of the theory about human behavior from social sciences in data-driven initiatives, etc.

Italian demographer Nicola Barban presented how digital data is used in contemporary demography. Annalisa Pelizza, in collaboration with Wouter Van Rossem, highlighted the importance of database structures operated by the EU states in profiling and framing migrants contacting with the European jurisdiction. Their lecture was accompanied by a short group exercise in network analysis.

During the second week, participants presented their own projects, after which they had time to work on them, receiving advice from teaching assistants on issues related to data processing, the use of appropriate statistical tools, and further improvement of research design.

**Debrief/Departure**

We realized that the formation of a schedule of hands-on sessions for two groups - basic and advanced, should not imply simultaneous classes. A number of topics covered in the advanced group were also relevant to the research projects of participants who chose to attend classes in the basic group. In the future, it would be better to draw up a schedule with consecutive classes.

The closing of SICSS Bologna was accompanied by a farewell aperitivo. We also made a gift in the form of a t-shirt and a bottle for all participants, speakers, and organizers.

<h2 class="display-4" id="covenant-university">SICSS-Covenant</h2>

SICSS-Covenant was hosted by the Centre for Economic Policy and Development Research (CEPDeR) at Covenant University, Nigeria, from 19 to 29 June 2022. The 10-day Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS) dubbed SICSS-Covenant 2022 was the first ever SICSS to be held in Nigeria and the ECOWAS Region. It was also one of three SICSS sites in Africa in 2022. This post-mortem on SICSS Covenant 2022 is divided into five main sections: 1) outreach and application process; 2) coding bootcamp 3) pre-arrival and onboarding; 4) the summer institute; 5) closing ceremony, departure and post-departure.

### Outreach and Application Process

We decided that our summer institute would focus primarily on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and we sought to explore how computational social science methods could contribute to better tracking of the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in African countries. We engaged two teaching assistants: one had prior experience with coordinating large academic events at Covenant University, while the other had a computer science background with significant coding experience. In choosing these two, we considered gender, their unique talents, and their potential to enrich the programme and effectively manage the diversities of the selected participants.

With regards to recruitment drive for participants, we solicited applications with several intentions. Chief among this was that we wanted a diverse yet cohesive group of participants in terms of skill sets and interests. We were also conscious that there were only two other sites in Africa and, as a result, were willing to consider and partially fund six applicants from other African countries.
We leveraged our networks as alumni of SICSS-Cape Town to reach out to colleagues to spread the word among students and early careers in their network. We also tried to reach potentially interested participants through emails to faculty that we thought might know interested participants. In addition, we targeted other top African universities (the University of Ghana and the University of Witwatersrand) and hosted a post-presentation information session with their students and early career researchers. Also, the CEPDeR fellows’ network across African countries and Covenant University platforms were utilised as the call for applications was showcased on their websites. Lastly, we placed advertisements in the newsletters/forums of the African Population Studies and AuthorAID, and announced the call for applications on our personal websites and other platforms like the [R-blogger](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/01/announcing-the-summer-institute-in-computational-social-science-covenant-university-nigeria/).

All applications were managed through a customised Google Form that sought information about participants’ evaluation of their own proficiency in R-programming and Python in addition to basic socio-demographic questions. We had a lengthy discussion about whether to accept letters of recommendation, particularly given earlier reports of their limited usefulness at previously held SICSS at other sites. Ultimately, we decided to request for recommendation letters primarily to filter the pool of applicants and focus on those who have carefully read the programme information and are likely to participate fully in the programme. We reviewed our pool of applications frequently and intensified our recruitment efforts targeting specific groups as the need arose.

We believe that the combination of our recruitment methods worked quite well because of the overwhelming number of applications we received despite this being our inaugural SICSS. We received 104 applications, mostly from Nigeria (75%) but also from other African countries, including Ghana (3), South Africa (3), Kenya (2), Zambia (2) and others. Our applicants were also very diverse in terms of research expertise, mostly from Economics (33), Sociology/Demography (32), but also from Computer Science (10), Geography (6) and others. The gender distribution of our applicants shows a higher proportion of male compared to female applicants (Fig. 1).

_Fig. 1: Gender Distribution of Applicants by Qualification_
<img src="https://ibb.co/cxzGw3d" alt="" width="600">

Three reviewers comprising one Covenant University faculty, a TA, and an organizer assessed each application independently. During the review process, we considered the diversity of research interests and whether there could be synergy in research collaborations. We also carefully reviewed the applicants’ motivation for participating in the programme and re-evaluated the role of recommendation letters. Although we discovered that the letters were not critical for our evaluation as they did not offer additional information than we obtained in other application materials, we hope to still request for letters of recommendation to limit the number of applications we have to screen in the future.

We then sorted applicants according to the average scores from the three reviewers. During the application review phase, we discovered many participants overestimated their proficiency in R/Python. In contrast, we realised that many of them only had some quantitative and statistical background but with very limited coding experience. We believe this issue cuts across Africa, especially because the computational social science (CSS) community in Africa is not as strong as in many other parts of the world. Based on our own evaluation of the applicants’ coding experience, we decided to follow a two-stage selection process in which applicants were first conditionally accepted and only given an unconditional offer once they had fully completed the coding bootcamp and demonstrated some proficiency in R-programming. This decision significantly reduced our pool of applicants to 29 conditionally accepted applicants who were enrolled in the coding bootcamp and 16 applicants who were offered an unconditional acceptance and ultimately attended the summer institute. Due to funding constraints and high regional flight costs, particularly from Malawi and Mozambique, three participants were invited but could not afford the flight cost to the summer institute even with partial funding.

### Coding Bootcamp

After conditionally selecting our participants, we decided that our primary programming language would be R, given the relatively few numbers of conditionally accepted applicants who were familiar with or interested in using Python. We did not emphasise one programming language over the other during our outreach activities but think that our team’s collective area of expertise may have influenced the pool of applications we received. In the future, we hope to partner with more colleagues in Computer Science to enhance the representation and mutual benefit of both programming languages, even more so now with the integration of R and Rstudio (now Posit).

We received generous support from DataCamp to access over 360 interactive courses through DataCamp for the Classroom. This support lessened the burden of a virtual bootcamp on the organizing team while also providing a valuable opportunity to track our participants’ progress (see Fig. 2). We assigned a total of 19 courses covering a diverse range of topics (data wrangling, data analysis, data visualization and an introduction to programming) in R to the participants to complete over five weeks. Each course requires about four hours to complete, but the completion time could vary depending on the participant’s proficiency in coding. For most, this was manageable (particularly students), but for some, this was quite a lot to juggle amongst other work, family-related demands, and other competing activities at the time. We did not anticipate the burden these courses would have on our participants and the impacts on the attrition rate. In the future, we will allocate more weeks for the participants to complete the courses and conditionally accept more applicants.
The teaching assistants supported our conditionally accepted applicants. We also created a dedicated channel #sicss-covenant on Slack and asked the participants to reach us there if they required assistance with any aspect of the coding bootcamp. Participants did not access TA/computational help resources as often as we would have expected. We hypothesize that this may have occurred for a couple of reasons. First, the DataCamp virtual environment made learning fun, and there were hints for each exercise. Second, participants were hesitant about being the first to seek help in an open forum. In the future, we might ask participants to share the most challenging coding exercise that they managed to solve on their own and their winning solution on Slack. We think this may work well, given that participants are more willing to share their successes than failures. Also, knowing where they struggled and how they solved it may be helpful for other participants.
We tracked the participants’ progress every week. We sent targeted emails based on whether they were on track (likely to complete the week’s exercise), stalled (yet to start the week’s exercise) or not started (not completed their registration on DataCamp). We also think the DataCamp leader board may have fostered healthy competition among our participants.

### Pre-arrival and Onboarding

About three weeks to the start of the summer institute, we reviewed our applicants’ progress and unconditionally accepted those who have completed a significant number of courses. After the participants were unconditionally accepted, we begun to onboard them into the program. Our onboarding process included several steps, including gathering participant information and populating the people page. We shared a link to a Google form with the participants to fill out the “onboarding survey” to provide bio information for our website. We provided the participants with links to important sections of our website, including the schedule (with reading materials) and the people page (to know who is coming to SICSS-Covenant). We also included a link to the pre-arrival section of our location’s webpage and shared travel guidance to Covenant University and Nigeria (for international participants). We communicated with the participants primarily through email but also via the Slack channel. Due to the popularity of WhatsApp in our setting, our TAs also created and managed a WhatsApp group for emergency/informal updates.

### Summer Institute

In designing and developing the program, we relied on our collective experience as participants and a teaching assistant at SICSS-Cape Town, as well as our experience organising similar academic events. We set up goals that revolve around three blocks based on our applicants’ motivation: **training** of the next generation of computational social scientists who will be able to teach others and develop new tools; generate sound scholarly **research** evidence that leverages computational and digital tools to better understand the society and accelerate progress towards the SDG; build long-lasting academic/research **collaborations**.
To achieve these objectives, we structured our programme to be composed of five components: a research happy hour, invited presentations, tutorials, joint programmes with other sites, and group projects.

**Research Happy Hour**

Research happy hour emerged as one of the most exciting aspects of our programme as it was intended to prepare our participants for the invited presentations as well as tutorials. All participants were assigned four research articles to read, review and discuss. We asked groups to focus on the rationale of the study, the methodology and potential to replicate the results, limitations, and ethics, as well as how they could tailor the methods to their area of expertise.
During the research happy hour, the groups collate their ideas and share their key takeaways with everyone. To avoid having a few participants dominate group discussions, we asked each group to appoint a discussion leader and a rapporteur. No group member can take the same role twice at any time during the summer institute. Participants really enjoyed this aspect of the programme, and several reported that it prepared them for the main sessions of the day. Given the engagement and how the participants found it helpful, we would encourage other sites, particularly those with participants with limited CSS experience, to consider incorporating it into their programme.

**Invited Presentations**

During initial planning, we decided it was best to amend the lecture content into a live presentation to encourage participant engagement. We also focused on topics highly relevant to our site theme and collective research interests. We targeted researchers and academics who have an interest in Africa. Unfortunately, our preference for African-focused presentations and speakers limited our pool of potential speakers and made it challenging to find willing speakers. This challenge, however, reinforces the need for increased investment in CSS training and research in African countries.
Ultimately, we had nine fantastic speakers who shared their work on different aspects of CSS (including bibliometric analysis, sentiment/text analysis, machine learning, and new methods for survey research) with our participants. We were particularly fascinated by the level of detail in these presentations and their willingness to share their slides and code with our participants despite our inability to offer a reasonable honorarium due to funding constraints. Given the fact that most of our speakers were overseas, we were worried that an all-virtual speaker presentation would limit speaker-participant engagement and an opportunity to have a one-on-one session with the speakers. We allocated ample time (105 minutes) to each presentation so that there was enough time to interact with the speakers. In the future, we hope to attract more local speakers and additional funding to cover travel costs for speakers and offer a more reasonable honorarium in recognition of their efforts and time.

**Tutorials**

In addition to invited presentations, we incorporated tutorials into our programme, focusing on different aspects of programming and CSS (text analysis, machine learning, spatial analysis, r-package development, reproducible analysis). All the tutorials (except text analysis) were held live and supported by the TAs on-site. We note that the overall rating was very high for all the tutorials especially given that our tutorial leads were highly experienced and adapted their tutorials to suit our context (Nigeria).
There were some critical comments as well. Most importantly, our participants affirmed that condensing the programme into ten days rather than a full-two-week summer institute did not allow for a good balance between learning and practice. While virtual presentations also worked very well, the virtual environment for tutorials evidently did not work well for our group. A number of technical and infrastructural challenges (for example, slow PC processing speed and internet connection for installing packages) significantly affected some of our participants’ pace and ability to follow many of the tutorials. In the meantime, we have uploaded some of the tutorials on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq_kVsuQoMoW3nat49IyuYJUJGPB-WTcx) and made all teaching materials publicly available while in the future, we will extend the summer institute to two full weeks and focus on a single theme each day. Other programming tutorials (such as spatial analysis, R-package development, and reproducible analysis) will be held in the second week with group projects.

**Joint Programme with other Sites**

We collaborated with SICSS-Howard, SICSS-JIAS/IPATC, and SICSS-West Central Africa to organise a panel session focused on interrogating data collection strategies in Africa. We had a series of preparatory meetings, and when the event was finalised, we shared the information with our participants. Many of our participants enjoyed the session as it fostered a sense of shared experience. We hope to explore (with colleagues) opportunities for fostering cross-site interactions during this event so that our participants can interact with each other (our third goal - collaboration).
Although the mass collaboration/experiments session and the fragile families challenge are indeed exciting and could foster collaboration, we could not incorporate them into our programme because we wanted to tailor the programme specifically for the needs of our participants while also considering their technical skills. Instead, we liaised with an African-led data science company Zindi to provide our participants with a similar experience. Though Zindi was open and willing to sponsor a hackathon and provide our participants with their data science (or CSS) competition platform, we could not see the engagement through because of our extremely late engagement with the Zindi team. In the future, we hope to still liaise with Zindi and partner with other African sites.

**Group Projects**

A major part of SICSS is group research projects. Our experience from participating in previous SICSS has taught us that leaving the participants to develop CSS-focused research question, particularly among participants with limited CSS experience like ours, often leads to very ambitious projects. While it is important that participants also experience this research development phase, we decided that the most successful approach was to identify important research questions based on the topics covered during the summer institute. In line with this, we identified three important research questions that centre around different dimensions of the sustainable development goals (SDGs): good health and wellbeing (Goal 3), gender equality (Goal 5), and reduced inequalities (Goal 10).
In choosing our final projects, we were conscious of financial constraints and only shared projects that did not require funding or fieldwork with the team. Before their assignment to groups, we asked the participants to select two CSS methods they were likely to use in their work. We then assign participants to work on the pre-defined projects based on their interests and technical strength. This way, the participants hit the ground running and were able to complete significant work in the little time available. The participants worked well together, and it was particularly exciting to see how they applied their skills to new problems.

### Closing Ceremony, Departure and Post-Departure

**Closing Ceremony and Departure**

Our closing ceremony featured presentations of preliminary findings from all the group projects. The presentations and discussions were lively, and it was a great way to wrap up the week. The groups enjoyed sharing their ideas and discussing what worked and what could be done better. We distributed SWAG t-shirts to participants, and all participants were given a certificate of attendance. Ultimately, we were very happy with our cohort. It was particularly heart-warming for us to see the seriousness with which the participants engaged with all aspects of the programme, including the research happy hour, invited presentations, tutorials and group projects. We believe that our rigorous selection process may have contributed to our overall experience and helped us select participants who were likely to participate fully in the programme.

**Post-Departure**

We believe that our work has just begun at SICSS-Covenant. Over the coming months, we hope to support the groups to see their works through to dissemination and publication. We have also encouraged our participants to stay in touch with the SICSS community through our Slack channel, Facebook, WhatsApp group and participation in virtual group meetings.
