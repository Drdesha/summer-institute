From July 15 to July 26, 2024, the Methods and Data Access Unit (UMAD) - Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of the Republic of Uruguay will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of the Republic. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Master's students, PhD students or professionals in the Social Sciences (Sociology, Political Science, Communication or related areas), who wish to deepen their knowledge in the use of computational methods and tools for the analysis of social data. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 15 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2024/odissei/apply) are due Monday, May 1, 2024 at 23:59 UYT.
