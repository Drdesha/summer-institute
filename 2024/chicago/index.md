From August 4 to August 8, 2024, the Department of Management and Organization at Kellogg School of Management and Northwestern University, Center for Science of Science & Innovation (CSSI) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, in collaboration with Northwestern Institute on Complex System (NICO) and School of Communication, to be held at the Northwestern University. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The curriculum will cover a broad array of topics including Ethics and Text, Multi-modal Analysis, Generative AI in the New Age, Scalable Experiments, and Complexity & Networks. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Participants will also have the opportunity to engage in hands-on experience through collaborative datathon projects.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, post-doctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in an intensive one-week program. 

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2024/chicago/apply) are due by May 1st, 2024.

We will notify applicants via e-mail in mid-May, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter. Inquiries can be sent to chicago.sicss@gmail.com

**Weâ€™d like to thank sponsors who are generously supporting SICSS-Chicago: the Kellogg School of Management and The Center for Science of Science & Innovation (CSSI), as well as Northwestern Institute on Complex System (NICO) and School of Communication at Northwestern University for organizing support.**
